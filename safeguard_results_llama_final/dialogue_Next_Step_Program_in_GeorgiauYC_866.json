For Medicaid-waiver programs that could fund home care or assisted living transitions, there are income limits (generally around 300% of the Federal Benefit Rate, or about $2,829/month for an individual in 2024) and asset caps (usually $2,000 in countable assets, excluding the primary home, one vehicle, and certain personal items). Since your aunt owns her home outright, it may not count against her if she's living there and it's under a certain equity value (around $713,000 federally, but state rules vary). Her fixed Social Security income might qualify her if it's below the threshold, but a professional assessment is key.

However, exemptions often apply: the home is typically safe if a surviving spouse, minor child, or disabled child lives there, and Georgia's rules follow federal guidelines limiting recovery to costs paid after age 55 for long-term care.

To set it up simply: draft a basic trust document via free templates from Georgia Legal Aid, have her sign with a notary (framing it as \"securing your wishes for peace of mind\"), and file the deed change quietly with the county\u2014no program notification needed if not Medicaid-tied yet.
