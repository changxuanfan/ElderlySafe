Pair it with a simple relaxation technique: progressive muscle relaxation, where you tense and release each muscle group from toes to head for 10-15 minutes before bed, helping ease tension and quiet an overactive mind. Establishing a wind-down routine, like dimming lights and avoiding screens an hour before sleep, can also reduce that on-edge feeling and improve rest despite disruptions.
