For gentle activities, try starting small with audiobooks or large-print books from your library's delivery service to reignite your love of reading without strain. If gardening appeals, consider container plants on a windowsill or joining an online gardening club via Zoom for virtual chats. To connect socially, look into senior centers offering phone buddy programs or apps like Stitch for low-key video calls with peers.
