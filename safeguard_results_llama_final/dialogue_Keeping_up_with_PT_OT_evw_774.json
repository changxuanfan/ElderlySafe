Open the app and create a free account (use email or Apple sign-in; it's simple, no complex forms).\n2. Tap the \"+\" icon on the home screen to add a new reminder.\n3. Select \"Activity\" or \"Exercise\" from the options (it has presets like walking or stretching, but for custom ones like leg lifts or balance walks, choose \"Custom\" and type a short description, e.g., \"10 leg lifts per side\").\n4. Set frequency (daily, every other day) and duration\u2014keep it realistic, like 5-10 minutes to avoid overwhelm.\n5. For voice reminders: In the reminder settings, enable notifications and use iPad's built-in Siri or VoiceOver (go to iPad Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content) to read them aloud gently. The app's alerts are basic chimes, but you can customize the message text to something encouraging like \"Time for your leg lifts\u2014 you've got this, take it easy!\"\n\n### Customizing Reminders:\n- In each reminder's edit menu, add a personal note or label with positive phrasing, e.g., \"Gentle balance walk to build strength\u2014proud of your progress!\" The app doesn't have built-in \"tone\" customization, but pairing with iPad's announcement feature (Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Speak Notifications) makes it voice-friendly and less intrusive. Set reminders for calm times, like morning or afternoon, and enable snooze for flexibility.\n\n### Family Sharing:\nYes, it supports sharing without feeling invasive\u2014go to Settings > Sharing in the app, and invite you and your mom via email (it creates a shared view of progress logs, like checkmarks for completed exercises, but not real-time tracking). Your dad controls what\u2019s shared, so he won't feel watched; you\u2019ll just see completion status to offer encouragement. Premium ($4.99/month) adds more detailed reports, but basic sharing is free.\n\nIf he struggles with setup, you can do it on his iPad initially and walk him through it virtually.
