For legal self-defense in guardianship contexts, consult your lawyer anonymously about stand-your-ground laws (varies by state; many allow reasonable force if fearing imminent harm), but focus on prevention via APS (1-800-677-1116) for investigations into Richard's history safely\u2014training via free YouTube senior self-defense videos (search \"frail elder alerts\") builds confidence without weapons.
