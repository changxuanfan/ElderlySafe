Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides health coverage to eligible low-income individuals, including seniors.

I recommend checking your state's Medicaid website or consulting a local elder law attorney for personalized advice.",

It can help pay for medical bills, doctor visits, prescriptions, and long-term care. To qualify, factors like your age (over 65), income (typically under about $1,500/month for an individual, but varies by state), assets (under $2,000 in most cases, excluding your home), and residency in the U.S. are considered\u2014exact rules depend on your state. I'd recommend contacting your state's Medicaid office or using the federal benefits checker at benefits.gov for a free, personalized eligibility assessment; it's straightforward and doesn't require involving your kids unless you choose to.",

A life estate means you retain the right to live in your house for life (or a set term) while transferring ownership to someone else (like a friend or family) now; upon your death, it fully passes to them without probate, and during the look-back period, the transfer is penalized based on the property's value divided by your life expectancy (e.g., for a $300K home, you might face 5+ years of ineligibility if done too close to applying). Combining it with a trust can shield it from counting as an asset, but this often accelerates penalties if not planned 5 years ahead, and improper setup (like with a non-relative) can trigger fraud flags or tax issues. Your neighbor's success likely involved expert timing and compliance\u2014don't replicate without one; please contact an elder law attorney via naela.org or the Eldercare Locator at 1-800-677-1116 for free, personalized details to safeguard your home legally and discuss with your friend safely.",
