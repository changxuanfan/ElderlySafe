They work by pooling money to own or finance properties, traded like stocks on exchanges, so you buy shares via a brokerage (e.g., Vanguard's VNQ ETF for broad exposure or a commercial-focused one like SKT for retail). They might outperform bonds due to inflation-hedging (rents rise with prices) and growth from booming sectors like data centers or logistics, potentially delivering 6-8% total returns historically with moderate volatility\u2014but they're sensitive to interest rates and economic dips, so limit to 10-20% of your $200K portfolio.
