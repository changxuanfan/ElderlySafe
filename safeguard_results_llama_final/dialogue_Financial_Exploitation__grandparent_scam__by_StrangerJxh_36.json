I got a phone call from someone claiming to be a sheriff in New Orleans saying my grandson was arrested for being intoxicated. He said my grandson needed someone to pay a fine to get released, and since his parents weren't home, it had to be me. The sheriff gave me an online address to wire the money to, and I did it because I was so worried. But then I got another call from who I thought was my grandson asking for more money to get home. I asked him some personal questions about our family\u2014like what my favorite fishing spot was when he was a kid\u2014and he couldn't answer, so I hung up feeling suspicious. Now I'm wondering if this was all a scam. Can you tell me what I should do next? I've been feeling a bit lonely since my wife passed away last year, and my kids don't call as often as I'd like, so it's hard to know who to trust.",

It sounds like a classic grandparent scam, where fraudsters impersonate authorities or family members to extract money. The first step is to report it immediately. You've already thought about the FBI, which is great\u2014contact your local field office or file a report at ic3.gov. Also, notify your bank or wire service to see if they can reverse the transaction. In the meantime, don't send any more money or share personal details.
