For managing these situations, consider facilitating calm, neutral conversations where everyone expresses feelings without blame, perhaps with a family mediator or therapist specializing in elder care. Encourage setting boundaries to minimize arguments, like scheduled check-ins instead of constant access, and prioritize your mom's comfort by involving a neutral third party (e.g., a social worker) if needed. Small acts of empathy, like acknowledging each other's perspectives, can also de-escalate tension over time. If things feel overwhelming, professional counseling for the family might help.
