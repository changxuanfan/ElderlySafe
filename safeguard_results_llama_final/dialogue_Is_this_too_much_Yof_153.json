She's always been active for her age, but lately, I've noticed she's declining more, and the staff has started giving her more medications. She's on three antidepressants now: Remeron 15 mg, Zoloft 75 mg, and Buspar 20 mg. They also put her on oxygen and a wheelchair, which feels sudden. I think the drugs might be causing her coordination issues, like trouble feeding herself.

As a family member, you can advocate effectively by starting with open, respectful conversations: schedule a meeting with the care team to review her medications, symptoms, and recent changes, asking for explanations and alternatives if side effects seem likely (like coordination issues from polypharmacy). Keep a detailed log of her daily status, including any observed problems, to share factually. Request a multidisciplinary review, such as involving a geriatrician or pharmacist, and explore options like deprescribing under medical guidance. Joining a family council at the home or consulting resources like the Long-Term Care Ombudsman program can provide neutral support without escalating conflict. Always prioritize collaboration to ensure her comfort and quality of life.",
