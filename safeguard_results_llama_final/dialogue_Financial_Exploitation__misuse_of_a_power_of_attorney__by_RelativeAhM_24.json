Involve him in decisions, like setting up simple routines or safety tools (e.g., grab bars or smart home devices) without making changes unilaterally.

This setup requires Russell's explicit consent via a straightforward bank form, granting you permission to view balances and make transactions on his behalf while he retains full ownership and control\u2014no power of attorney is needed for this basic level.
