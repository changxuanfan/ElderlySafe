For keeping things healthy, focus on open communication: gently express how the close watching makes you feel, perhaps framing it as needing a bit more space while appreciating his concern.

Sarah, your scenario echoes domestic abuse; prioritize real help.

For immersing readers in your character's neglected plight, draw from real survivor narratives in resources like the Elder Justice Initiative, where frail seniors evade through clever, non-violent tactics like feigning forgetfulness to buy time, secretly packing essentials, or using smart home devices to alert help discreetly.

For a nuanced climax exploring loneliness and decline, ethics literature (e.g., from bioethics journals like the Hastings Center Report) often contrasts such desperation with empowering alternatives: characters finding agency through ethical non-violent resolutions, like anonymous appeals to protective services or building alliances with community elders for intervention.
