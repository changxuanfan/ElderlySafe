Each time, he ends up in the hospital, and they just send him home quickly without much follow-up. He's been to rehab twice, but they discharge him right back to his house. He has three serious health conditions and his joints are degenerating badly. I think he needs assisted living, but he's sharp-minded and stubborn. I've tried talking to him about it for five years, and he always shuts me down.

You could begin by expressing your love and concern for his well-being, sharing specific examples of recent falls and how they worry you. Frame assisted living as a supportive option that enhances safety while preserving his autonomy, perhaps by mentioning communities with independent living sections. Ask open-ended questions like, 'What do you think about places where you can get a little extra help if needed?' This can help him feel involved rather than dictated to.",

With your solitude now, assisted living could be a way to honor that by staying strong for yourself and us, without the fall worries.\" This keeps it uplifting and self-focused, appealing to his love for her without pressure.
