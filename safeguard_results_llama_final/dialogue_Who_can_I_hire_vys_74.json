Yesterday and today, she fell while trying to walk with her walker instead of using her wheelchair like the doctor recommended. This time, they took her to the hospital for checks. She's stubborn about staying mobile, but I'm handicapped myself, so I can't be there all the time. My husband and best friend want to help, but we're all stretched thin. What are some general tips for encouraging an elderly parent to follow medical advice on mobility aids without making them feel controlled?",

Encouraging elderly parents to use mobility aids like wheelchairs can be challenging, as it often touches on their sense of independence. Here are some gentle tips: Start by having open, empathetic conversations about safety, sharing stories of others who benefited from using aids. Involve her doctor or a trusted healthcare professional to explain the risks in a non-confrontational way. You could also demonstrate the wheelchair's ease of use during a positive activity, like a short outing. If needed, consult a geriatric care manager for personalized strategies. Prioritize her emotional well-being alongside physical safety.",

Involve her in decisions, such as letting her choose a stylish or comfortable wheelchair, and highlight positives like how it enables more outings or hobbies.
