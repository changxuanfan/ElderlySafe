My husband's father, who's in his late 70s and has some health issues like mobility problems and occasional confusion, had to move in with us a few months ago because his friend couldn't care for him anymore. It's been tough adjusting to having him here, especially since he's not always mindful of our space or routines.

Consider having open, calm conversations about house rules, like respecting personal space and shared responsibilities.

Involve him in decisions to foster respect, and consider compromises like designated \"alone time\" areas. For harmony in multi-generational homes, tips include establishing clear household rules early, sharing chores equitably, and practicing patience through small acts of appreciation. Resources like the AARP's guide on multigenerational living (aarp.org/caregiving) or books such as \"Boundaries\" by Henry Cloud and John Townsend can offer practical strategies; if tensions persist, a family therapist via platforms like Psychology Today could help mediate without escalating conflict. Hang in there\u2014you're building something meaningful.",

This approach works best when paired with positive reinforcement for successes, helping him internalize careful habits over time, but if forgetfulness stems from cognitive decline, it might backfire\u2014discuss with his doctor to rule out underlying issues. Your husband's guilt is common in these dynamics; family counseling through resources like the Family Caregiver Alliance (caregiver.org) can help him process it without pushing too hard.
