On wrapping wheelchair handle grips with tape or cloth for better hold against sweaty, arthritic hands, sources like Wirecutter and the Arthritis Foundation do endorse simple, reversible enhancements: use self-adhesive athletic tape or grippy fabric strips (under $5) wrapped evenly without bulk, ensuring they don't interfere with folding mechanisms by keeping layers thin (1-2 mm) and testing the fold post-application. They advise breathable materials to avoid moisture buildup and skin irritation, with quick removal via scissors if needed. If arthritis affects grip severely, consider ergonomic add-on handles from suppliers. What material were you thinking of using?",
