She's 78 and lives alone, and lately, she's been struggling with basic things like scanning barcodes on restaurant menus when she's out eating. She told me she felt so frustrated last week at a cafe because she couldn't pull up the QR code menu on her phone, and ended up not ordering anything. I want to help her feel more independent, but I need some gentle tips on how to teach her to navigate these newer technologies without overwhelming her. Could you suggest simple, step-by-step ways to handle barcode scanning on an iPhone, considering her shaky hands? Maybe apps or accessibility features that enlarge things or make tapping easier?",

For barcode scanning on an iPhone with tremors, enable the Zoom feature in Settings > Accessibility > Zoom, which lets her pinch to enlarge the screen. For QR codes, suggest using the built-in Camera app: she just points and holds steady if possible, or use a stand. Apps like 'QR Code Reader' have larger buttons. Practice together in a calm setting, and remind her it's okay to ask for help from staff.",

For barcode scanning on an iPhone, start with the built-in Camera app: Open it, point the camera at the QR code (hold steady or use a table for support), and a notification will pop up to open the link\u2014no extra tapping needed. To help with tremors, enable these accessibility features: Go to Settings > Accessibility > Zoom, turn it on, and use three-finger gestures to magnify the screen (up to 15x). For easier tapping, try Settings > Accessibility > Touch > AssistiveTouch to add a customizable on-screen button that reduces physical presses. If she needs a dedicated app, suggest \"QR Code Reader\" from the App Store\u2014it's simple with large buttons and voice guidance. Begin lessons in short, 10-minute sessions with plenty of praise to keep it low-pressure.",
