Can you give me some general advice on how to approach an elderly family member who's been through a lot, especially if they've had some distance?

Listen more than you talk, validate their feelings if they open up, and respect their energy levels by keeping visits short (15-30 minutes at first). If distance has built up, express your care simply, like \"I've been thinking about you and wanted to hear how you're doing,\" and suggest easy ways to stay connected, such as regular texts or shared activities they enjoy.

Minimal force still risks harm, especially with age differences\u2014avoid it entirely. Psychological insights: Use empathy, 'I learned from my mistakes to protect us both.'
