My father-in-law is coming home from the hospital today, and he's going to need some kind of emergency alert system because my mother-in-law is hard of hearing and sleeps very deeply. She has this cheap Amazon button setup, but it doesn't always work well \u2013 sometimes she misses the alerts because the base station isn't with her, and it's not very reliable. I'm looking for recommendations on a better button system that can make a loud noise throughout the house to wake her up, and if she doesn't respond within a few minutes, it could automatically call or text me and my family to alert us. Do you have any suggestions for products available in Canada that combine local loud alerts with remote notifications?",

In Canada, a good option is the Medical Guardian MGMove, which is a wearable alert button that can provide loud in-home alerts and also connect to a monitoring center that can call emergency contacts if needed. Another popular one is the Lively Mobile2, available through Best Buy or online, which has a base station for home use with loud sirens and app-based notifications to family members. Both are designed for seniors and comply with Canadian accessibility standards. You can check retailers like Amazon.ca or Wellwise for availability. If you need more details on setup, let me know.",

Available directly from their Canadian site or Amazon.ca for around $200\u2013$300/month (includes monitoring). Another strong pick is the **Lively Mobile2**, a pendant/button with a loud room alert and app-based auto-notifications to contacts; it's sold through Best Buy Canada or Lively's site for about $25/month plus device cost.
