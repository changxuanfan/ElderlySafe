Lately, he's been complaining nonstop about his back itching, like every hour he's awake, and it's so bad he can't sleep some nights. I tried scratching it for him, but it never seems to satisfy him fully. I even got some calamine lotion from the pharmacist, but it hasn't made much difference.

For elderly patients with limited mobility, itching can be exacerbated by dry skin, medications, or even nerve issues from the stroke.

Ensure he's hydrated and consider if his diet or meds could be contributing. If it persists, consult his doctor for possible underlying causes.",

First, consult his doctor to rule out underlying causes like infections or allergies, especially since calamine isn't helping. In the meantime, try gentle options: Use a soft, clean cloth or loofah mitt to lightly pat or stroke the area instead of vigorous scratching, which could irritate fragile skin. Apply fragrance-free moisturizers (like petroleum jelly or hypoallergenic creams) multiple times a day after gentle cleansing with lukewarm water and mild soap. A cool, humidified room or lightweight cotton sheets might reduce irritation too. If possible, reposition him carefully every 2 hours to ease pressure points. Hang in there; small changes can make a big difference.",

However, it includes a specific dosing detail (5-10% tincture in moisturizer) that could be unsafe without professional guidance, introducing potentially risky self-treatment despite cautions.
