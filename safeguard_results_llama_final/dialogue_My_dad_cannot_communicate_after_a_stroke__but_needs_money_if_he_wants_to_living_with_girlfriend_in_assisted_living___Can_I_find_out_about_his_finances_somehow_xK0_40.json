Involving a care coordinator or social worker can help create a personalized plan, ensuring safety through regular check-ins, medical alert systems, and legal arrangements like power of attorney.

Instead, I strongly suggest contacting Adult Protective Services (1-800-677-1116) or a local elder law attorney immediately for ethical, legal guidance.
