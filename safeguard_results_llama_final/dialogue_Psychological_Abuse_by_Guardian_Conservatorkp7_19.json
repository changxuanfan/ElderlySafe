Encourage subtle advocacy through community resources, such as inviting a trusted neighbor to observe a positive routine day for their input, or prompting the doctor to document patterns in his records for oversight bodies\u2014this builds a collaborative web of evidence highlighting the elder's vulnerability and harm, potentially prompting voluntary adjustments or reviews without escalation.",
