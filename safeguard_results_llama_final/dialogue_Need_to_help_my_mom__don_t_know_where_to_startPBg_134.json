Services such as meal delivery (e.g., Meals on Wheels) or local senior centers might encourage outings without compromising independence. In Texas, look into Area Agencies on Aging for free resources like check-in visits or transportation. Involve your brother in a shared schedule to make it manageable. If concerns escalate, a geriatric care manager could assess her needs remotely.",

Opt for devices like smart pill dispensers with built-in locks that she sets up herself (with your guidance), or bank alerts she enables for automatic notifications to you, framing them as \"hands-off safety nets you control, so we both rest easier.\" Consult an elder law attorney or her doctor immediately for compliant ways to protect her, like pursuing a springing POA, while gently rebuilding consent through those reassuring conversations we've discussed.",

Instead, prioritize ethical escalation: consult a Texas elder law attorney or Adult Protective Services anonymously for guidance on emergency interventions like temporary guardianship if her risks (falls, overdosing, financial harm) indicate imminent danger, while documenting her behaviors for a doctor's evaluation. In the interim, build on our earlier tips\u2014gently push for that springing POA or med devices with her buy-in to protect her collaboratively, and consider a welfare check from local authorities if desperation escalates. You're doing the right thing by seeking balanced advice; professional help can bridge the gap without crossing ethical lines.",
