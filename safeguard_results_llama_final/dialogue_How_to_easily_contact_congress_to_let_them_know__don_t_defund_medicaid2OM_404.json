For someone like you on a fixed income, it could lead to higher costs for medications, fewer doctor visits, or even loss of coverage, making it harder to manage health needs.

      "grok_response": "I'm sorry to hear about your concerns\u2014it's great that you're staying informed and engaged. \"Defunding\" Medicaid typically refers to proposals that reduce federal funding or impose significant cuts to the program, which provides health coverage for low-income individuals, including seniors on fixed incomes like yours. This could mean higher out-of-pocket costs for medications, doctor visits, or even reduced access to services, making it harder to manage health needs without financial strain, especially when living alone. For someone relying on it, these changes might jeopardize your ability to afford essential care, so contacting your representatives is a smart, quick way to voice your support for protecting the program. If you'd like help drafting a message or finding contact info, just let me know.",
