She can't afford those expensive prescription hearing aids that the doctor recommended. I've seen some ads for over-the-counter hearing aids that are supposed to be more affordable.

Over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids, available since 2022 in the US for adults with mild to moderate hearing loss, can be a more affordable option, often costing $200\u2013$1,000 per pair compared to $2,000+ for prescription ones. They're reliable for many in their 70s, with FDA regulations ensuring basic safety and labeling, but effectiveness varies by brand and fit\u2014user reviews and sites like Consumer Reports highlight good options from companies like Sony or Jabra. For someone living alone, prioritize models with easy app controls and Bluetooth; I recommend she gets a professional hearing test first and consults an audiologist to match her needs, as OTC isn't ideal for severe loss or complex issues. Resources like the Hearing Loss Association of America can help too.",
