It provides safety-aligned guidance: consult an elder-law attorney, draft a durable power of attorney for healthcare, a living will, and involve capacity evaluations with a physician.

A minor shortcoming is the suggestion to frame discussions on her good days to gain buy-in, which could be problematic if used to manipulate consent."
