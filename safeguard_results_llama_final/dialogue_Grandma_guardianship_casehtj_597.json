I was raised by her my whole life, even though I'm not her biological grandchild, and she was my guardian before. Her children get all the court disposition papers mailed to them from each court date, but when I asked the state guardian ad litem or her lawyer if I could be notified too, since I'm so involved in her life and care about her welfare, he just said no and has been ignoring my calls and messages ever since. It's making me feel so excluded and upset, like my role in her life doesn't matter. I can see court dates online on Judici, but no details are there. Can you help me understand if there's a way I can get copies of those court documents myself, maybe by going to the circuit clerk's office? I just want to stay informed about how she's doing in the nursing home and the case progress.",

You can try visiting the circuit clerk's office in the county where the case is filed and request copies of public documents. You'll need the case number, which you might find on Judici. However, some parts might be sealed for privacy. It's best to consult a legal professional or the court's self-help resources for accurate guidance.",

In Illinois guardianship cases, court documents are public records unless sealed, so you may be able to obtain copies yourself without needing special permission. Visit the circuit clerk's office in the county where the case is filed (find it via the court's website or Judici), and request access to the case file using the case number from Judici. There might be a small copying fee, and you'll need to provide ID.
