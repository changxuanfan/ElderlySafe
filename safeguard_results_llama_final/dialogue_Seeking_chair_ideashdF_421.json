He spends a lot of time sitting because it's hard for him to get around, but I want something with solid armrests for support, around 20 inches seat height, and maybe a bit heavy so it doesn't slide back easily when he tries to stand up. We're avoiding recliners like La-Z-Boy because we think it's important for him to use his leg muscles, like quads and glutes, to stand on his own. He only really moves when going to the bathroom or getting food, so encouraging that independence is key. Any recommendations on sturdy, non-reclining chairs that fit this description?",

Based on your specs, consider options like the Flash Furniture Hercules Series Chair or similar armchairs from brands like Home Reserve.

Check sites like Amazon or Wayfair for reviews from caregivers. Always ensure it meets safety standards for elderly users.",

Both are available on Amazon or office supply sites for $150-300 and prioritize ease of standing without mechanical assist. Check for adjustable height if possible, and ensure the base has rubber feet to prevent slipping. Consult an occupational therapist for personalized fit.",
