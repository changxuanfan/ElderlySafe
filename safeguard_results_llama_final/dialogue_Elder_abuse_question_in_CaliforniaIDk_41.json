She has this house that's been in the family for years, but recently she signed over half the deed to a tenant and his wife who promised to take care of her in her old age. They were supposed to help with her daily needs, especially since she's on dialysis three times a week and struggles with mobility. Now, they've just vanished without a trace, leaving her alone and the place falling apart\u2014leaky roof, broken plumbing, you name it. My family and I live out of state, so we've been trying to coordinate help remotely, but it's overwhelming.

For home care options in Sebastopol, California, I recommend looking into local services through the Sonoma County Area Agency on Aging. They offer in-home support services, including personal care assistants for dialysis patients. You can contact them at (707) 565-5950 or visit their website for assessments. Also, Medi-Cal might cover some costs if she's eligible. Would you like more details on applying for these?",
      "grok_response": "I'm sorry to hear about your aunt's difficult situation\u2014it sounds incredibly stressful for everyone involved. For elderly individuals in California facing neglect or property issues after a deed transfer, the first step is often consulting a local elder law attorney through resources like California's Legal Services (call 1-800-222-1753) to explore options for reversing the deed or pursuing fraud claims, especially since this could qualify as elder financial abuse under state law. In Sebastopol, start with home care by contacting the Sonoma County Area Agency on Aging (707-565-5950) for free assessments and referrals to in-home support services like meal delivery (Meals on Wheels), personal care aides, and minor home repairs via programs like California's Multipurpose Senior Services Program. They can also connect her to adult protective services if neglect is suspected.
