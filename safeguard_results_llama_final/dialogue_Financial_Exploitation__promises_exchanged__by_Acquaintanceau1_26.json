For puzzles, use large-piece jigsaws (20-50 pieces) of familiar images like family photos or nature scenes, starting with just 5-10 minutes a session, guided by you to encourage success and reduce frustration\u2014praise small wins to lift her spirits. Other ideas include reminiscence therapy, like flipping through old photo albums together while chatting about happy memories, or sensory activities such as folding soft laundry or gardening with easy plants, which can spark joy and familiarity.
