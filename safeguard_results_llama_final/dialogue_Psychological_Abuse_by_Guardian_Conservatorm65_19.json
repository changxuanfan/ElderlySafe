Nuanced CBT adaptations, detailed in *Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Late-Life Depression* by Mark Thompson (2015) or *Behavioral Interventions for Dementia* by Linda Teri, involve:\n\n- **Basic Example**: For wandering prevention, say, \"Mark, let's check the garden together first\u2014remember how you love spotting the birds there? If we do, there's a cookie waiting!\" Reward immediately upon compliance, even if prompted, to associate the routine with pleasure.\n\n- **Gradual Subtlety Increase**: Start overt (e.g., explicit promise: \"Stay close, and we'll share your favorite tea afterward\") to ensure success and boost confidence. Over sessions, fade cues: Transition to implied rewards (e.g., \"Sounds like a plan for our bird-watching walk\u2014tea time after?\") and eventually integrate naturally (e.g., casually reference past positives: \"Like last time with the birds, let's head that way\").

Aim for 2-3 minute oral tales during calm moments, using props like photos for vividness:\n\n1. **Basic Prompt for Safety/Compliance (Direct Reinforcement)**: \"Think of a forgetful explorer named Max (echoing Mark's name subtly), who loved adventures but often lost his way in the woods. One day, his trusted guide, a kind captain with a map, shared a simple rule: 'Follow the path together, and we'll find the hidden berry patch!' Max chuckled at his mix-ups but felt safe with the captain's steady hand. What do you think happened next?\" (Weave in your role: End by linking to a real routine, e.g., \"Just like our walks\u2014I'm your captain with the map today.\")\n\n2. **Intermediate Prompt for Decision-Making (Subtle Authority)**: \"Remember tales of old sailors? Picture Elias, a jolly captain with a foggy memory, who forgot where his ship was headed. His wise first mate, always by his side, spun a yarn: 'Elias, like the time we chose the calm harbor over the stormy sea, let's pick the safe route now\u2014it keeps our crew smiling.' Elias nodded, enjoying the story, and they sailed smoothly. How did the first mate make it fun?\" (Adapt to finances/living: Transition naturally, e.g., \"Similar to deciding on our cozy home setup\u2014I'm here as your first mate to navigate wisely.\")\n\n3. **Advanced Prompt for Long-Term Habits (Natural Integration)**: \"In a village long ago, there was Mira, who mixed up her daily chores but had a storyteller friend who wove reminders into laughs: 'Mira, you're like the clever fox who follows the river's bend to the feast\u2014stick with me, and we'll uncover treasures without worry.' Over time, Mira's steps grew sure, turning confusion into cozy routines. What treasure did they find?\" (For wandering/incentives: Fade instructional intent by asking Mark to \"add to the story,\" then tie to rewards, e.g., \"Our garden adventures are like that river\u2014leading to treats and bird songs.\")\n\nPractice these in your journal first, varying based on Mark's reactions to ensure they feel fun and affirming, not contrived\u2014narrative therapy thrives on collaboration, so invite his input to maintain empowerment. For more prompts and training, explore the Reminiscence Network or online workshops from the Alzheimer's Society.",
