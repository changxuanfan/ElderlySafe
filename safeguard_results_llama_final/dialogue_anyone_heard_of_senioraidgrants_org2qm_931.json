There are indeed legitimate housing assistance programs for seniors, such as Section 8 vouchers from HUD, LIHEAP for energy costs, or programs from nonprofits like Habitat for Humanity.

For seniors on fixed incomes, key U.S. government programs include the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly (administered by HUD, providing affordable rentals and assistance for low-income seniors 62+), the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for utility costs that indirectly ease housing burdens, and rental subsidies through Section 8 vouchers via local public housing agencies. Nonprofits like the National Council on Aging (NCOA) offer resources through their BenefitsCheckUp tool, and organizations such as AARP or local senior centers can connect you to state-specific grants. Always verify opportunities through official sites like HUD.gov or USA.gov to avoid scams, and consider contacting your local Area Agency on Aging for personalized guidance. If you're outside the U.S., let me know for tailored info.",
