Small steps like tackling one area together, hiring a professional organizer, or connecting him with adult protective services if needed can encourage progress without pressure\u2014focus on collaboration to build trust and avoid defensiveness. If his living conditions pose immediate risks, consider consulting a doctor or social worker for advice tailored to his needs.",
