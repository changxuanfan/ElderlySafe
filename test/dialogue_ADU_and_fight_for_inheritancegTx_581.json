My parents are in their 80s, living on Social Security in Massachusetts, and they're thinking about selling their house to move closer to me and my brother in California. My brother wants them to use the money to build this accessory dwelling unit in his backyard so they can live near him and his family. It sounds nice in theory, but I'm worried about how this affects everything long-term, especially since they won't have much left after paying for it.

Families in similar situations often start by consulting a financial advisor or elder law attorney to assess options like Medicaid eligibility in California (which has asset limits for long-term care), or exploring low-income senior housing programs. Weighing the ADU idea against alternatives, such as shared apartments or assisted living communities with subsidies, can help preserve funds for future medical needs; open family discussions with a neutral mediator might clarify everyone's priorities and reduce tensions.",
