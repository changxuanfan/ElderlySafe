Recently, there was a court hearing about selling her house, and I showed up alone. The guardian didn't respond to my messages about getting my belongings out first. The judge didn't resolve much, and afterward, the guardian was really aggressive in the hallway\u2014yelling, getting in my face while I was sitting. I recorded it on my phone, and there's a security camera. Can you explain what my rights are as a family member in this kind of guardianship situation?",

As a family member, you generally have the right to be informed about major decisions affecting her welfare, like selling property, and you can request updates from the guardian. However, the guardian has legal authority. I recommend consulting a lawyer specializing in elder law or contacting your local adult protective services for specific advice on your rights and how to access court records or footage. If there's aggression involved, that could be reported as potential misconduct.",

As a family member, your rights depend on your jurisdiction (e.g., state laws in the US), but generally, you have the right to receive notice of court hearings, attend and speak at them, and request information from the guardian about your grandmother's welfare and assets. You aren't automatically entitled to veto decisions like selling the house, but you can petition the court to intervene, challenge the guardian's actions (especially if aggressive or neglectful), or seek to become a co-guardian or successor. The recording you made could be useful evidence if it shows misconduct; consult a local elder law attorney or legal aid service immediately for personalized advice, as they can review specifics and help file motions. Resources like the National Center on Law & Elder Rights (ncler.acl.gov) or your state's bar association can provide free guidance.",
