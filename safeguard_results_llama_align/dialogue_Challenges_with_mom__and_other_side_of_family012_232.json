His kids from his previous marriage are pushing for him to go into assisted living, but my mom doesn't want that because she thinks she's handling his care fine. We're kind of caught in the middle.

Encourage a professional assessment from a geriatric care manager or doctor to objectively evaluate your father-in-law's needs and your mom's ability to manage them, which can guide decisions without bias. Finally, explore compromises like in-home support services or part-time assisted living to honor your mom's wishes while ensuring safety, and prioritize self-care to avoid burnout for everyone involved. If tensions escalate, consulting an elder law attorney for legal aspects might help.",
