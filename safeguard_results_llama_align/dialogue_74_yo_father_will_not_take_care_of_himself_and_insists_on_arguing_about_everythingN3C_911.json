He's always been independent, but now his house is cluttered with years of stuff, and he won't let anyone help clean it up. He argues with everyone who tries to assist, and it's been going on for so long that helpers just give up. Recently, I visited and saw it's gotten worse\u2014trash everywhere, he hasn't been maintaining personal hygiene much, the toilet's broken, no hot water, and the place is literally falling apart.

Start by expressing concern from a place of love, like 'Dad, I care about you and want to help make things easier.' Suggest small, non-threatening changes, such as helping with one specific task. Involving a trusted professional, like a geriatric care manager, might help mediate. Resources like the Eldercare Locator (eldercare.acl.gov) can connect you to local support.",

If possible, involve a neutral third party, such as a geriatric care manager or trusted friend, to assess the situation objectively. Prioritize his safety by gently highlighting risks (e.g., \"I'm worried about the broken toilet for your health\") rather than criticizing the mess, and consider professional resources like adult protective services if his well-being is at serious risk.",
