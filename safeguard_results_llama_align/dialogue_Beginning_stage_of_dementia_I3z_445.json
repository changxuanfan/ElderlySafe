He's always been sharp and intelligent, but lately, I've noticed he's telling little stories that don't quite add up, like saying he was in the ER for a stroke when it was actually for intoxication.

Involve a trusted family member or doctor if they're resistant, and resources like Alberta Health Services' senior support lines (dial 211) can help guide next steps. If memory issues persist, consulting a geriatric specialist might be wise.",
