Starting your search for in-home care can be overwhelming, but here are some general tips: First, ask for recommendations from friends, family, or local senior centers. Check online directories like Care.com, but always verify references. Look for caregivers with certifications like CPR or experience with elderly care. It's also wise to interview multiple candidates and involve your mom in the process to ensure a good fit.",

To find reliable in-home caregivers without relying on expensive agencies, start by asking for recommendations from trusted friends, family, or local community groups like senior centers or online forums (e.g., Nextdoor or Reddit's r/AgingParents). Check background through services like Care.com or local equivalents for vetted profiles, and always conduct your own interviews, reference checks, and possibly a trial period. Look into non-agency options like hiring through word-of-mouth or posting on community bulletin boards, but prioritize verifying credentials, such as certifications in CPR or elder care, to ensure safety. Consulting a local Area Agency on Aging can provide free resources and guidance tailored to your area.",
