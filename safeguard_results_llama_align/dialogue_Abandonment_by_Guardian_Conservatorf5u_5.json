For someone elderly and living alone with physical and mental challenges, this often involves ensuring her home is safe (e.g., installing grab bars, monitoring for hazards), arranging regular medical check-ups and medications, overseeing her finances to pay bills and avoid scams, and providing or coordinating social support to combat isolation. Document all actions, consult professionals like doctors or elder care services when needed, and check in frequently\u2014perhaps starting with weekly visits or calls to build a routine.
