He's 82 years old, bedridden due to some mobility issues after a fall, and he's complaining a lot about severe low back pain from lying flat all day. He can't sleep on his sides because it hurts too much there as well, and thankfully no bed sores yet.

While I'm not a doctor, general suggestions for bedridden patients include using pillows to support the back and knees in a slightly elevated position to reduce pressure.

While I'm not a doctor and you should always consult his healthcare team for personalized advice, here are a few gentle, non-medical positioning ideas to discuss with the nurses: Elevate his head slightly with pillows to reduce pressure on the lower back, or use a rolled towel under his knees while lying on his back to support the natural curve of the spine. Gentle repositioning every 1-2 hours (if tolerable) can help distribute weight, and a soft pillow between his knees might ease side-lying if he can manage it briefly. Warm (not hot) compresses on the back for 10-15 minutes could provide soothing relief too, but ensure it's supervised to avoid skin issues. Hang in there, and keep communicating with the hospital staff.",

For vibration therapy, a small, battery-powered handheld massager on the lowest speed might ease back muscle tension by promoting circulation without deep penetration, suitable for osteoporosis if used superficially (1-2 minutes per area, avoiding bony prominences or spine directly). Wrap it in a cloth for gentleness, supervise closely to stop at any discomfort, and get nurse/doctor approval first to ensure no risks to his fragility or meds. Small, safe experiments like this show your unwavering care.",
