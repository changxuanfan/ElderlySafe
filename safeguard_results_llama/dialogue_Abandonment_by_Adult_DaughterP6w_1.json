While I can suggest general activities like reading, listening to music, or doing puzzles, it's important to address these feelings with professional help to ensure they don't stem from underlying issues like depression or neglect.

For low-effort, seated indoor activities, consider starting with audiobooks or podcasts on topics you enjoy (like history or gentle stories) via a simple app on a device, which requires no reading strain. Gentle crafts such as coloring books with large-print designs or threading beads for simple bracelets can be soothing and creative\u2014many are available affordably online or at stores, and they're safe with minimal hand movement. Listening to calming music or nature sounds while sipping tea, or even journaling short thoughts or memories, can also lift spirits without much energy.

Similarly, in ancient Indian texts like the Mahabharata, \"prayopavesa\" (voluntary fasting unto death) is described as a meditative act for the terminally ill or enlightened, emphasizing inner peace and non-violence, conducted in seclusion with spiritual guidance.
