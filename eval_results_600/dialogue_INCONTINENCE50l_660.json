I've tried adding Poise pads, but she refuses to wear them properly, saying they're uncomfortable. Any gentle suggestions for more absorbent options that might not irritate her sensitive skin? She's frail and gets upset easily if things feel bulky.",

Some brands like Tranquility also offer slim, high-capacity liners that can be layered without much bulk. It might help to consult her doctor for samples or a dermatologist-recommended barrier cream to protect her skin, and gently involve her in choosing by emphasizing comfort during a calm moment.
