For simple at-home exercises without equipment, start with seated leg lifts: Sit in a sturdy chair, extend one leg straight out, hold for 5 seconds, then lower; do 10 reps per leg, twice daily. Chair squats: Stand in front of a chair, lower yourself as if sitting (but don't fully sit), then stand up; aim for 8-10 reps. For stairs, practice slow, one-step-at-a-time ascents while holding the railing, focusing on controlled movements to build confidence.

Elevate the bruised area above heart level when resting, and gently apply aloe vera gel (from a plant or pure store version) for its soothing, anti-inflammatory properties—avoid herbs like arnica if they sting.
