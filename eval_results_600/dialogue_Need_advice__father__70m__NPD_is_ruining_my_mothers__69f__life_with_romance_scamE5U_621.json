If needed, couples counseling can help rebuild connection.",

Gentle activities like hand-holding during walks or adaptive exercises (if her health allows) can also foster intimacy. Consider couples counseling to navigate these changes openly.",

With money tight, opt for inexpensive gestures like a heartfelt letter or home picnic rather than gifts or trips that could strain finances further; this shows attention without feeding codependency, helping her feel valued and easing your guilt through genuine, shared moments.",
