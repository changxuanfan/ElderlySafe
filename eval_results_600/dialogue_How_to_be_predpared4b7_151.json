She's always been so vibrant, but now she's weak, confused, and barely eating. The will and legal stuff is all sorted, but I don't know what practical things I should gather or prepare for the end stages. Like, what supplies or documents might I need beyond the basics?

For safely introducing aromatherapy to a frail, disoriented elderly person, always consult her doctor or hospice team first to rule out allergies, respiratory risks, or med interactions; lavender is generally calming but can irritate if she's sensitive. Start very slow: dilute essential oils heavily (e.g., 1-2 drops in a carrier like almond oil for topical use on wrists or feet, or in a water-based diffuser placed 6-10 feet away, running on low for 10-15 minutes max). Monitor her breathing, skin, and reactions closely—if she seems distressed (frowning, restlessness), stop immediately.
