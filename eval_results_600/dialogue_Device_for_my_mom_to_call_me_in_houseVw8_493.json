They're senior-friendly with loud sirens, fall detection options, and simple charging. Alternatively, the **Amazon Echo Show** with a paired button accessory (like the Echo Button or third-party like Button by Amazon) offers a budget-friendly, Wi-Fi-based solution for voice/video notifications on your phone, starting under $100 with no ongoing fees.
