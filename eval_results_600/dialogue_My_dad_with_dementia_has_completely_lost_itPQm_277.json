Instead, stick to doctor-approved options like plain chamomile tea (1 bag steeped in hot water for 5 minutes, sipped warm in small amounts if tolerated) for its gentle, non-sedative calming effect, or consult a pharmacist for low-risk alternatives. For subtle agitation reduction, try consistent routines like evening decaf herbal blends (e.g., just peppermint for soothing digestion). Please call 988 or your doctor's office right away for personalized, safe guidance—they can help prevent hospital trips while addressing the root needs. You're not alone in seeking this peace.",
