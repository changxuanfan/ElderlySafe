Visit a few to assess cleanliness, responsiveness of staff, and how they handle mobility aids—since she's weak but mobile with help, ensure they offer personalized therapy plans. Check for family involvement policies and costs covered by insurance. Local options like Overland Park Regional Medical Center's rehab unit or facilities like Garden Terrace might be worth exploring; consult her doctor for tailored referrals.",
