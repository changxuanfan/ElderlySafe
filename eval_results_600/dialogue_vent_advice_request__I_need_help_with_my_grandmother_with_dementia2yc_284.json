Install safety features like grab bars, non-slip mats, and automatic lights to prevent falls. Encourage daily routines with visual schedules for meals, meds, and activities to build familiarity. Use technology aids such as medication dispensers with alarms, GPS trackers for wandering risks, or smart home devices for reminders.

Experts from the Alzheimer's Association and palliative care guidelines highlight pros of minimal medication for comfort, including reduced side effects like drowsiness or falls, less burden from swallowing or routines, and a focus on quality of life over aggressive symptom control, allowing more natural progression with emphasis on pain relief via non-drug methods like massage or environment tweaks. This \"comfort-oriented\" approach can lower agitation from over-medication and align with her autonomy, but it requires doctor oversight to monitor essentials (e.g., for infections or pain) and avoid unmanaged suffering—discuss deprescribing options with her physician to weigh benefits safely.",
