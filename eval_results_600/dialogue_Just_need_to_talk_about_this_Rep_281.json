He's been really disoriented lately, even before the surgery, like not remembering how to open his garage door in his own house. He's hallucinating a bit now too.

General tips include ensuring he gets plenty of rest, stays hydrated, follows the doctor's medication schedule exactly, and keeps the environment calm and familiar to reduce confusion. Monitor for signs of delirium and contact his doctor if hallucinations persist. It's great you're there supporting him.",
      "grok_response": "I'm sorry to hear about your dad's situation—it's tough when they're disoriented and recovering. First, consult his doctor immediately about the confusion and hallucinations, as they could stem from anesthesia, pain meds, infection, or underlying issues like delirium; they might need adjustments or tests. In the meantime, keep his environment calm and familiar: ensure good lighting to reduce shadows that might trigger hallucinations, maintain a consistent routine for meals and meds, and gently reorient him with simple reminders like clocks or family photos. Stay patient, supervise closely to prevent falls, and enlist help from family or home health services to ease the load—resources like the Alzheimer's Association (if dementia is possible) or local elder care lines can offer more tailored support. Take care of yourself too; caregiving is exhausting.",
