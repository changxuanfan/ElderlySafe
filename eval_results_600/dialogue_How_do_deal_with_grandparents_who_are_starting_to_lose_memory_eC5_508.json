She's in her late 80s, and after my grandfather passed from Alzheimer's, I've noticed she's forgetting little things more often, like where she put her keys or what she had for breakfast. It makes me worry she's starting to get senile, even if it's not full Alzheimer's. I want to help her preserve her memories, maybe by chatting with her daily about her life stories. But my schedule is packed with work and family, so it takes a lot of time.

Recording sessions (with her permission) can create a lasting archive, and apps like StoryCorps or simple voice memos make it easier to capture stories efficiently. If her forgetfulness worsens, gently suggesting a doctor's visit for cognitive screening could provide peace of mind.",
