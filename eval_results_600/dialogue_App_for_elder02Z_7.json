Is it safe and easy to use for someone like me who's not great with technology?",

It allows family members to set reminders for things like medication or appointments, share photos, and even do drop-in video calls without needing to answer.

These are generally designed to be safe and easy for non-tech-savvy users, with large icons, voice guidance, and remote family management to avoid complex setups. To confirm safety, check reviews on the App Store or Google Play, ensure it's from a reputable developer, and verify it has strong privacy features like encrypted sharing. If it's for medications, pair it with a dedicated reminder app like Medisafe for reliability. Always consult your doctor for health advice.",
