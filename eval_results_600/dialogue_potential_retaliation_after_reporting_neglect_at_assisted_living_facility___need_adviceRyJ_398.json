If needed, involve a local ombudsman for senior care.",

To address the paging system issues at the assisted living facility, start by documenting everything: note dates, times, and details of incidents like the 30-minute wait, including any impact on your grandmother's well-being. Then, schedule a calm, in-person meeting with the facility's administrator or director of nursing—bring your notes and express concerns factually, focusing on safety and quality of care. Ask about their protocols for emergencies, any plans to fix the system, and how they're addressing staffing or response times. If they don't respond adequately, consider escalating to your state's long-term care ombudsman for free advocacy support. In the meantime, explore options like a personal alert device for your grandmother as a backup. Hang in there; taking these steps can make a real difference.",
