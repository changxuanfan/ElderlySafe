General tips include involving her in creating a simple, visual budget using apps like Mint or Excel to track expenses together; automating bill payments and limiting access to credit cards; setting up pre-authorized transfers to a savings account for essentials; and gently exploring underlying reasons for spending, perhaps with a geriatric counselor. Small, collaborative steps can build trust and reduce workarounds.",
