To gently fill those days, consider starting small with solo gardening adaptations, like planting low-maintenance perennials in a dedicated \"memory bed\" where you can reflect on your time together. Joining a local bereavement support group or senior center could connect you with others who understand, while volunteering at a community garden or library might bring purpose and new friendships. Simple walks in nature or listening to audiobooks of shared interests can also ease the emptiness—take it one step at a time, and be kind to yourself.",

Use auto-pay for recurring bills through your bank to avoid late fees, and review your bank statements monthly online or with a trusted advisor from a senior center. For savings, consider a high-yield account at your bank for easy access, and perhaps consult a free financial counselor through AARP or your local elder services to set up a basic budget without involving your children unless you choose to.

Yes, reverse mortgages are a type of loan designed for homeowners aged 62 and older, like you, where you borrow against your home's equity without monthly repayments; instead, the loan is repaid when you sell the home, move out, or pass away. It can provide cash as a lump sum, monthly payments, or a line of credit to supplement income, but it reduces your home equity over time and involves fees, interest, and counseling requirements to ensure you understand the risks, like potentially leaving less inheritance for your children. I recommend speaking with a HUD-approved counselor (free through the government) or a trusted financial advisor before considering one—they can explain if it fits your situation without pressure from ads.",

To maximize what your children might inherit, simple steps include: 1) Work with a HUD-approved counselor to review your options and ensure the loan is structured as a line of credit or smaller lump sum, minimizing how much you borrow. 2) During application, designate beneficiaries in estate planning documents like a will or trust (consult an elder law attorney for this—often low-cost through legal aid). 3) Keep records organized and communicate your wishes to your family early. 4) Monitor the loan annually to avoid surprises like unpaid taxes that could trigger repayment.
