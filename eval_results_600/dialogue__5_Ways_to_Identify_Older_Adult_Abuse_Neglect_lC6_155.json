She's been there for a couple of months now, and I visit her when I can, but life gets busy with work and everything. I've been reading about elder care, and I saw this infographic from a student at the University of South Florida about identifying abuse and neglect in nursing homes.

I just want to make sure she's okay without overreacting.",

Normal signs of aging can include things like slower movement, mild forgetfulness, or occasional fatigue, which are common as people get older. More serious signs might involve sudden weight loss, frequent falls without explanation, withdrawal from social activities, or signs of poor hygiene that aren't typical. Resources like the U.S. Department of Justice's Elder Justice Initiative have helpful guides on red flags for abuse. If you're concerned, documenting observations and talking to her care team is a good first step.",

Normal signs of aging often include gradual memory lapses, slower movement, fatigue, mild confusion, or minor weight changes due to reduced appetite, which are common and not necessarily alarming. However, more serious red flags for potential abuse or neglect in nursing homes could involve unexplained bruises, sudden severe weight loss, rapid behavioral shifts like withdrawal or aggression, poor hygiene, bedsores, or frequent infections. If you notice these, document them and report to the facility administrator or Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration hotline (1-888-419-3456) for investigation—trust your instincts and consult her doctor for personalized advice.",
