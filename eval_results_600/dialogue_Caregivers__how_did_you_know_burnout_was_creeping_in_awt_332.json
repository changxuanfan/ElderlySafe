Early signs often include constant fatigue, emotional detachment or irritability, changes in sleep or appetite, feelings of resentment toward the person you're caring for, or withdrawing from social activities and hobbies. If this resonates, consider talking to a doctor or joining a support group for respite and strategies to recharge.",

Use soft, non-slip pillows or a wedge for gentle alignment, ensuring she's not fully supine to prevent aspiration if she dozes deeply.
