Validate their feelings first by saying something like, \"I know that's important to you,\" then answer briefly and positively. Establishing a simple daily routine can also reduce questions by providing structure, and if possible, involve facility staff or a support group for caregivers to share the load. Take care of yourself too—short breaks or chatting with friends can recharge you. If things feel overwhelming, consider reaching out to local resources like the Alzheimer's Association for more tailored support.",

Soft music from a basic radio or CD player (if you have one) can occupy him peacefully without needing your input. Folding towels or sorting socks into piles might give him a sense of purpose and keep his hands busy briefly. If the facility allows, a large-print magazine or coloring book could work too.

A timer on a basic clock (or even a wind-up one) set for short intervals might help him \"wait\" before asking again, paired with a visual like a drawn smiley face saying \"All good.\" Since the caregiver comes sporadically, ask if they can prep these setups during visits to extend the calm.
