I usually spend summers tending to my large garden, planting flowers and vegetables that bring so much joy and keep me active. But now, with the snow everywhere, I can't go out much at my age of 85. I've been turning to my tablet to stay connected, mostly on Facebook and watching the news on TV.

It helps me feel informed without getting overwhelmed.",

On world events, tensions in the Middle East remain a key focus, with ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon drawing international calls for ceasefires, while Ukraine's war with Russia continues amid U.S. election shifts that could affect aid. In Asia, U.S.-China relations are strained over trade and Taiwan, but no major escalations today. Overall, it's a mix of diplomatic efforts and watchful waiting—nothing drastically new, but staying informed like this is a smart way to keep up without the stress. How's your son enjoying the winter days?",
