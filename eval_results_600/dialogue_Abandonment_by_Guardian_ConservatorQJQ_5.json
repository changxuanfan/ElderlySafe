She has some physical and mental disabilities that make her partially incapacitated, so the court thought it was best.

To avoid overwhelm, start by creating a simple checklist of her immediate needs, consult with her doctors or a local elder care advisor for tailored guidance, and consider seeking support from organizations like the National Guardianship Association or your state's adult protective services.

To meet minimal legal standards without overwhelming yourself or her privacy, aim for one in-person visit every two weeks initially, supplemented by weekly phone calls to monitor her well-being, medications, and home safety.
