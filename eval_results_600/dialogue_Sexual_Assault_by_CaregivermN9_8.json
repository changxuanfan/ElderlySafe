Skin sensitivity often heightens with age and stroke-related immobility. Gently discuss this with the caregiver for their observations, monitor for symptoms like odor, discharge, or fever, and consult his doctor promptly for a check-up—they can assess without unnecessary stress and recommend simple interventions like barrier creams or adjusted meds.
