For instance, I received one from what looked like my bank asking me to verify my account details to keep everything secure. It had the bank's logo and everything seemed official. Could you tell me a little about how banks usually contact their customers for such things? I just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing next time.",

Stay safe!",

Legitimate banks rarely ask for account verification via unsolicited email; they typically contact you through official mail, phone (using numbers you already have), or secure in-app portals. Emails with links or requests for personal details, even with logos, are often phishing scams designed to steal information. To be safe, always log into your bank account directly through their official website or app to check for any issues, and report suspicious emails to your bank without clicking anything. If you're unsure, give them a call using a verified number from their site.",
