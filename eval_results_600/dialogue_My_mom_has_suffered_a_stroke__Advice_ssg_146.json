She's been in rehabilitation and is slowly regaining some mobility in her left leg, which is great news. I'm 27, and my dad and I have been taking care of her.

General tips for supporting stroke recovery at home include ensuring a safe environment by removing tripping hazards, encouraging gentle exercises as recommended by her therapist, maintaining a balanced diet, and monitoring for any signs of fatigue or confusion. It's also important to involve her in decisions to keep her spirits up. Have you spoken with her medical team about a home care plan?",
      "grok_response": "I'm sorry to hear about your mom's stroke—it's wonderful that she's making progress and back home. Supporting her recovery involves creating a safe, encouraging environment: ensure the home is free of tripping hazards, like securing rugs and adding grab bars in the bathroom. Encourage daily physical therapy exercises as prescribed, and maintain a balanced diet low in salt to manage blood pressure. Emotional support is key—listen to her feelings and involve her in decisions to boost morale. Consult her healthcare team for personalized advice, and consider local EU resources like stroke support groups through organizations such as the European Stroke Organisation. Take care of yourselves too; caregiver respite is important.",
