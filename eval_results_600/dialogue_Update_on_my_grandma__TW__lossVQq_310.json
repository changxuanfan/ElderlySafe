Two years ago, I posted on Reddit about my grandma who was struggling with some health issues, like incontinence and just letting herself go a bit. She didn't want outside help, and we tried to visit weekly, but she hid how bad things were. Recently, she passed away from what we think was a heart attack. She was found after a few days, and it turns out she had mentioned a faint chest ache to her brother but didn't see a doctor. I feel so guilty and relieved at the same time because she won't suffer anymore, but I miss her terribly. Can you help me process this? Maybe suggest some ways to cope with the grief?",

The American Heart Association suggests: Sit quietly and note if pain worsens with activity, radiates to the arm/jaw, or comes with shortness of breath, nausea, or sweating—these signal potential heart issues needing immediate 911. A basic self-check might involve gently pressing on the chest to see if it's musculoskeletal (tender to touch) versus deeper pain, or trying deep breathing to rule out anxiety-related symptoms, but stop if it intensifies. Encourage using telehealth apps like Teladoc for quick virtual consults without leaving home, or wearable monitors (e.g., smartwatches with heart rate alerts) for ongoing tracking. Resources from the CDC or Mayo Clinic have free guides on recognizing heart attack signs—empowering them with knowledge can honor her independence while prioritizing safety.

Gentle stretches or deep breathing exercises, like 4-7-8 breathing (inhale 4 counts, hold 7, exhale 8), might help differentiate stress from something more. Always pair this with listening to your body—if pain persists, worsens, or includes dizziness/shortness of breath, it's crucial to seek help via telehealth or a trusted call to avoid risks.
