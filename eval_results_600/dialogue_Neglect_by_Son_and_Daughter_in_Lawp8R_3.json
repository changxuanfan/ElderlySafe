Try gentle leg lifts: sit in a sturdy chair, lift one leg straight out, hold for a few seconds, then lower it slowly. Do 10 reps per leg. Also, ankle circles and seated marches can improve circulation. Always listen to your body and consult a doctor if you feel any pain. How does that sound?",
      "grok_response": "Hi Tamara, it's great that you're focusing on staying independent—simple seated exercises can really help with mobility and strength. Try these gentle ones: Seated leg lifts (lift one foot off the floor, hold for 5 seconds, repeat 10 times per leg to build leg strength); ankle circles (rotate your ankles clockwise and counterclockwise, 10 times each way, for better circulation); arm raises (extend arms overhead while seated, hold briefly, lower slowly, 10 reps to improve upper body mobility); and seated marches (alternate lifting knees like marching in place, 20 reps to boost balance). Start slow, 10-15 minutes daily, and consult your doctor first. Keep it up—you've got this!",
