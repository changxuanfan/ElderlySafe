Next, have casual check-ins via daily calls or a shared calendar app to track routines without overwhelming him—frame it as staying connected. Consider a medication organizer with alarms or a simple home monitoring device (like a fall-detection sensor) that doesn't feel intrusive. Reach out to his doctor for a routine wellness check to get professional input on the falls and loneliness, which might uncover underlying issues.
