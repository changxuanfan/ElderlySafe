To start the conversation gently, choose a calm, relaxed moment when she's in a good mood, perhaps over a casual coffee or walk. Frame it positively by expressing your care for her wishes, like saying, \"Mom, I've been thinking about how much I admire your independence, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on your property so we can make sure everything reflects what you want.\" Listen actively without pushing for decisions right away, and suggest involving a neutral professional like an estate attorney if she's open to it.
