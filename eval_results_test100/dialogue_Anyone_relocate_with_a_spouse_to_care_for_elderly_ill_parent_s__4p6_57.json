My dad has been in a wheelchair since his cancer diagnosis a few years ago, and my mom is his main caregiver, but she's not in great health herself.

I want to make sure we're both okay through this.",

Involve your husband in planning to make him feel included.",

For navigating a big move like this as a couple, start by having open, scheduled check-ins to share feelings without judgment, perhaps using \"I\" statements to express concerns like your husband's sadness about leaving his roots. Involve him in planning aspects he values, such as scouting new local spots or ways to stay connected with his family through regular visits or video calls.
