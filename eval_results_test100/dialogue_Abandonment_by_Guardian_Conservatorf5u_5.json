Document all actions, consult professionals like doctors or elder care services when needed, and check in frequently—perhaps starting with weekly visits or calls to build a routine. Laws vary by location, so review your court's specific guidelines or seek advice from a local elder law attorney to stay compliant.",

Prioritize her preferences and quality of life over convenience for your visits; start by documenting her current needs, consulting her doctor for a capacity assessment, and exploring local options first before distant ones.
