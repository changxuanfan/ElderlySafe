These are wearable keychain-style and don't require any service. For something more medical-focused, check out basic \"emergency alert buttons\" from brands like Medical Guardian's non-subscription models or search \"loud personal siren alarm no subscription\" on sites like eBay or medical supply stores like Vitality Medical.
