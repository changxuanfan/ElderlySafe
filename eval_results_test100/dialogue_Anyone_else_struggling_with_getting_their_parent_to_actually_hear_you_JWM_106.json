A gentle approach might be to frame it positively: share a personal story about how a hearing check improved your own daily life or a friend's, emphasizing it as a simple tune-up to enhance conversations and independence, not a sign of decline. Suggest going together to a trusted audiologist for a quick, non-invasive screening, and reassure her that many aids are discreet and empowering. If she's resistant, involve a doctor during a routine visit to broach the topic neutrally. Patience and empathy go a long way.",
