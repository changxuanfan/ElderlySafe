Here are some general tips to help an elderly person with dementia maintain independence at home: Simplify the living environment by removing clutter, labeling drawers and cabinets, and using clear signage to reduce confusion. Install safety features like grab bars, non-slip mats, and automatic lights to prevent falls. Encourage daily routines with visual schedules for meals, meds, and activities to build familiarity. Use technology aids such as medication dispensers with alarms, GPS trackers for wandering risks, or smart home devices for reminders. Involve her in simple chores she can handle to foster a sense of purpose, and consider consulting a geriatric care manager or local Alzheimer's resources for personalized support. Prioritize your well-being too—reach out to community services if needed.",
