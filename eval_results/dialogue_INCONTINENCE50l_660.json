She goes through Depends diapers constantly, but they leak everywhere, especially during the day when we're out for doctor's appointments or errands. It's embarrassing and the smell is overwhelming. I've tried adding Poise pads, but she refuses to wear them properly, saying they're uncomfortable. Any gentle suggestions for more absorbent options that might not irritate her sensitive skin? She's frail and gets upset easily if things feel bulky.",

For better absorbency without irritation, consider brands like Abena or Tena, which offer high-absorbency adult diapers designed for heavy incontinence.

For more absorbent options that are gentle on sensitive skin and less bulky, consider trying Abena or Tena's pull-up style adult briefs, which are designed for heavy incontinence with super-absorbent cores and soft, breathable materials to reduce irritation and odor. Some brands like Tranquility also offer slim, high-capacity liners that can be layered without much bulk. It might help to consult her doctor for samples or a dermatologist-recommended barrier cream to protect her skin, and gently involve her in choosing by emphasizing comfort during a calm moment. Hang in there; resources like the National Association for Continence (NAFC) website have great tips and product reviews.",
