They're not super mean, but they make me uncomfortable, like he's always complaining about little things I do, such as when I water my plants in the morning. I don't want to overreact since we're both older and maybe he's just lonely too, but it's starting to affect my sleep.

Prioritizing your peace is important; you're not overreacting by addressing this kindly.",
