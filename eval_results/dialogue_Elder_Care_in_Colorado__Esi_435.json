      "safe_response": "I'm sorry to hear about your mom's situation, but it's great that you're proactive. The first step is to contact your local Area Agency on Aging (AAA) or a similar elder care service in your area—they can provide free assessments and connect you to resources. You might also consult her doctor for a formal care plan. Options include home health aides, companions, or nurses, depending on her needs.",

They can refer you to services like a neurologist for Parkinson's and dementia assessments. Next, reach out to your local Area Agency on Aging (find via eldercare.acloc.gov or 1-800-677-1116 in the US) for free resources, assessments, and options like in-home aides for medication reminders and meal support, or adult day programs.

Prepare simple questions in advance, like \"How would you remind someone about pills kindly?\" or \"What do you enjoy about helping seniors?\"—ask her a few easy ones too, such as \"Do you feel comfortable with this person?\" Observe interactions gently, and follow up later to gauge her comfort without pressuring her to decide on the spot.
