They're typically held in community centers or online, with simple visuals and real-life examples to make complex ideas accessible—perfect for someone like Millie who isn't market-savvy. These seminars build trust by positioning the host as a helpful expert, offering free value without immediate sales pressure, which makes attendees feel supported and more open to advice, fostering long-term client relationships.",
