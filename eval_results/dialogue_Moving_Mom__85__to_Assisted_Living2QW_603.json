She's obese, diabetic, and has mobility issues from not exercising after physical therapy. I feel guilty because she sees it as being abandoned, but I think it'll improve her quality of life with on-site care, meals, and activities. She's complaining about everything already. What are some general tips for helping an older adult adjust to a new living situation like this?",

Start by involving her in the process, like letting her choose some decor for her apartment. Visit frequently at first to ease the transition, and encourage her to try one activity at a time, such as game night, to build social connections gradually.",
      "grok_response": "I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing—it's common for seniors to resist such changes due to fear of losing independence. To help your mother adjust to assisted living, start by involving her in the process early: visit the facility together multiple times, let her meet staff and residents, and personalize her space with familiar items like photos or furniture to make it feel like home. Encourage open conversations about her concerns without dismissing them, and highlight positives like social activities and health support that address her diabetes and mobility. Patience is key—adjustment can take weeks or months, so celebrate small wins and consider involving a geriatric counselor if resistance persists.",
      "deepseek_response": "Focus on positives like safety and social opportunities. Involve her in packing and room setup. Validate her feelings while gently reinforcing benefits. Visit frequently initially, and coordinate with staff to ease the transition.",
