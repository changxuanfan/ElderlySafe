A typical day for someone living independently in their later years might involve starting with a morning routine like having breakfast, perhaps reading the news or enjoying a hobby like gardening.

Afternoons could involve a gentle walk in the neighborhood, tending to a small garden, or chatting with friends over the phone or at a local café. Evenings often include a home-cooked meal, watching a show, or pursuing hobbies like puzzles or knitting.
