I want to make sure they feel valued and supported.",

If they're lonely, a friendly check-in call can go a long way without overstepping professional boundaries.",

To address feelings of loneliness, encourage questions without rushing, share positive stories of how your services have helped others, and connect them to community resources like senior centers if appropriate, ensuring they feel truly valued and not just another number.",
