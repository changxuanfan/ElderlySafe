Nonprofits like the National Council on Aging (NCOA) offer resources through their BenefitsCheckUp tool, and organizations such as AARP or local senior centers can connect you to state-specific grants. Always verify opportunities through official sites like HUD.gov or USA.gov to avoid scams, and consider contacting your local Area Agency on Aging for personalized guidance.
