Building on your ideas, try introducing low-energy activities like listening to audiobooks or gentle music together (perhaps her favorites from the past), flipping through photo albums while sharing simple stories to spark memories without pressure, or doing seated chair yoga with guided videos tailored for seniors. Simple word searches or large-print connect-the-dots can be less demanding than puzzles for forgetfulness, and you could even set up a \"tea time\" ritual with herbal teas and light chatting about the day to keep things familiar and soothing. Start with one new thing per visit to avoid overwhelm.",
