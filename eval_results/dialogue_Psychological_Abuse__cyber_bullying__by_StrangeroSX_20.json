Start by approaching her in person calmly and kindly, perhaps over a short chat at her door, explaining your concerns without blame (e.g., \"I've been finding the noise a bit tough; could we find a way to make it quieter?\"). If that doesn't help, involve a neutral third party like your community's mediator, resident manager, or social services for seniors, who can facilitate understanding, especially if forgetfulness is a factor. Document incidents politely for your records, and consider resources like local elder mediation programs to keep things peaceful. Prioritizing empathy often leads to better resolutions.",
