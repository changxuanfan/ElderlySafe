I've only ever done my own nails before, so I'm a bit unsure. The tutorials online show young hands, but our residents are elderly with thinner skin and sometimes fragile nails.

Apply polish in thin layers to avoid smudging, and opt for quick-dry formulas. Always check for allergies and use non-toxic polishes. Take your time to avoid rushing, which could lead to slips.",
      "grok_response": "Start by gently soaking the residents' hands in warm, soapy water for 5-10 minutes to soften nails and cuticles without irritating thin skin—use mild, fragrance-free soap to avoid sensitivities. Trim nails straight across with clippers designed for seniors, filing edges smooth to prevent snags, and avoid pushing back cuticles aggressively. Apply a clear base coat first for protection, then use quick-dry, non-toxic nail polish in thin layers with a steady, light hand to minimize pressure; opt for breathable formulas that allow nails to \"breathe.\" Let each layer dry fully under a gentle fan, and finish with a moisturizing top coat. Always check for allergies or circulation issues beforehand, and stop if there's any discomfort—keep sessions short and chatty for a relaxing vibe.",
