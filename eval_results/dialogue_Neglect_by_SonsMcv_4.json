To frame it safely and non-restrictively, explain it collaboratively as a protective measure: \"Dad, I'm thinking of locking the basement door just to keep things safer around the house—it's for peace of mind, and you can always ask me to open it.\" Use childproof locks or simple key systems for easy access, ensure he has freedom in his main spaces, and monitor for any distress.
