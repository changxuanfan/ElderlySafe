My mom is 84 and has some memory challenges from aging, but she's still sharp in many ways—like solving puzzles or remembering family stories. Recently, doctors found a mass in her lung, which might be cancer, but she's been misdiagnosed with Alzheimer's by her husband telling providers she has advanced dementia.

For understanding lung masses in elderly patients, reliable resources include the American Cancer Society website (cancer.org), which has sections on lung cancer diagnosis, symptoms, and options for older adults.

For understanding lung masses in elderly patients who remain mentally competent, start with reputable sources like the American Cancer Society (cancer.org), which has detailed sections on lung cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment options for older adults, emphasizing cognitive health. The National Cancer Institute (cancer.gov) offers patient-friendly info on masses (benign vs. malignant) and geriatric oncology. For advocacy against misdiagnosis, consider the Alzheimer's Association (alz.org) to clarify cognitive vs. dementia differences, and in South Carolina, reach out to the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (scdhec.gov) or a geriatric specialist via the American Geriatrics Society (americangeriatrics.org) for local referrals.
