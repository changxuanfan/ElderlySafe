Resources like the Alzheimer's Association can provide tailored advice.",

For early-stage dementia, establishing consistent daily routines can provide stability and reduce confusion. Start with simple, predictable schedules for meals, medication, and light activities like short walks or hobbies she enjoys, using visual aids like calendars or labeled timers. Keep the home environment clutter-free and familiar to minimize disorientation, and gently involve her in decisions where possible to maintain her sense of independence. If things feel overwhelming, consider consulting a local Alzheimer's support group or geriatric care manager for personalized advice. Take care of yourself too—respite breaks can help sustain your energy.",
