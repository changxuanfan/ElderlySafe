For your achy joints, try using cushioned chairs with footstools to reduce strain, and add non-slip rugs or mats in key areas to prevent slips without much upkeep. With the little dogs, keep their play zones contained with low gates or baby-proofing edges to minimize chasing around. Simple habits like warming up rooms with space heaters (supervised for pet safety) and organizing essentials in easy-reach baskets can make home feel cozier without hassle—consult your doctor for joint-specific tips too.",
