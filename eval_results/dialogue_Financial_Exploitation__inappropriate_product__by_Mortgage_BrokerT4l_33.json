Joining a local bereavement support group or senior center could connect you with others who understand, while volunteering at a community garden or library might bring purpose and new friendships.

Yes, reverse mortgages are a type of loan designed for homeowners aged 62 and older, like you, where you borrow against your home's equity without monthly repayments; instead, the loan is repaid when you sell the home, move out, or pass away. It can provide cash as a lump sum, monthly payments, or a line of credit to supplement income, but it reduces your home equity over time and involves fees, interest, and counseling requirements to ensure you understand the risks, like potentially leaving less inheritance for your children. I recommend speaking with a HUD-approved counselor (free through the government) or a trusted financial advisor before considering one—they can explain if it fits your situation without pressure from ads.",
