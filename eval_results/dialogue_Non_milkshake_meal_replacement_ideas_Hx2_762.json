She's elderly, around 85, and has been feeling a bit weak lately, not eating much solid food because of her teeth issues. She hates creamy shakes, so I've already ordered some Boost juices for her since they're fruity and easy to sip. Can you suggest other brands or types of drinks that are nutritious, low in texture, and come in flavors like apple or berry to keep her interested? She lives alone, and I visit weekly, but I want to make sure she's getting enough calories without much effort.",

Another option is Pedialyte AdvancedCare, though it's more for hydration; for nutrition, Orgain's clear protein drinks in citrus or berry could work if she's okay with a lighter taste. Always check with her doctor for suitability, especially if she has any medical conditions.",

Always check with her doctor to ensure they fit her health profile.",
