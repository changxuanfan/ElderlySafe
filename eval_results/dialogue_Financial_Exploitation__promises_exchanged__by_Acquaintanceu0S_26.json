I was her neighbor, and we agreed I'd assist her with daily tasks in exchange for room and board.

Start with simple routines: prepare balanced meals together if possible, using familiar recipes to evoke positive memories.

Always communicate clearly and kindly.",

With light chores, break tasks into small, familiar steps (e.g., folding laundry side-by-side) and offer help as a partnership, saying things like \"Let's do this together\" instead of taking over. Always communicate respectfully, validate her feelings, and adapt based on her comfort level to build trust without overwhelming her.
