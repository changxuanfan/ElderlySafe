Widowed or single seniors may qualify for the Qualifying Widow(er) status for two years post-spouse's death, allowing the higher standard deduction and dependency exemptions if applicable. Social Security benefits are often partially taxable based on total income, and medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of AGI can be deducted.
