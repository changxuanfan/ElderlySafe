Some general tips include creating a schedule for family members to share duties, exploring local support groups for caregivers, and considering respite care services to give everyone a break.

To balance work and caregiving, start by assessing your mom's needs with a doctor's input to prioritize essentials like meds and meals, then explore in-home aides or adult day care for short-term relief. Use tools like shared family calendars for rotating responsibilities, and check local resources such as Area Agencies on Aging for respite grants or support groups. Don't forget self-care: even brief breaks can help prevent burnout, and consider flexible work options if possible. Hang in there; you're doing important work.",
