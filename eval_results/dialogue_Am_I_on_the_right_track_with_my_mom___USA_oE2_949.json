She's been bedridden since January, and today was tough because it was the first time she didn't recognize my dad, her husband of over 40 years. We've got round-the-clock care, and she's comfortable, no bedsores, good appetite, healthy weight, but she's frail and mentally fading.

For someone with advanced dementia who's bedridden, keeping a gentle routine can help maintain comfort and dignity.

Always consult her healthcare provider for personalized advice.",

For keeping her daily routine engaging without overexertion, focus on gentle, sensory activities like playing her favorite soft music or familiar scents (e.g., lavender or baked goods) to evoke memories; short, seated chats with photo albums or simple storytelling; light hand massages or gentle stretches guided by a caregiver; or watching calming nature videos together. Rotate these in short 10-15 minute sessions to match her energy, always prioritizing her comfort and cues for stopping. If possible, consult her care team for personalized tweaks.",
