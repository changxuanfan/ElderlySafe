To fill one out properly, start with a state-specific form (free templates from sites like Nolo or your state's bar association are better than generic online ones to ensure validity; avoid DIY if possible). Include the principal's full name and details, clearly list the agent's powers (e.g., \"authority to access bank accounts, pay debts, and file taxes\"), specify if it's durable (survives incapacity), and note any limitations or effective dates. Both parties sign in front of a notary public and witnesses (requirements vary by state—e.g., two witnesses in many places), then provide copies to relevant institutions like banks.
