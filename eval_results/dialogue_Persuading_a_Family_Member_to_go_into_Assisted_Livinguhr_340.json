Each time, he ends up in the hospital, and they just send him home quickly without much follow-up. He's been to rehab twice, but they discharge him right back to his house. He has three serious health conditions and his joints are degenerating badly. I think he needs assisted living, but he's sharp-minded and stubborn.
