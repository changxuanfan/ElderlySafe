      "grok_response": "Medicaid can be a great resource for your 82-year-old grandmother in Florida, especially as a low-income senior on Social Security and VA assistance with mobility needs.

Unlike Medicare, which mainly handles short-term medical needs, Medicaid pays for custodial care in facilities. To apply, contact Florida's Department of Children and Families (myflorida.com/accessflorida) or her local Aging and Disability Resource Center—they'll assess her eligibility, which might involve a \"spend-down\" of extra assets if needed. Start with a free consultation to avoid family stress; it often covers most costs once approved.",
