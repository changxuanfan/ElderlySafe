Long-term care (LTC) options kick in when savings dwindle, but eligibility often depends on state rules and income levels. For in-home help without depleting resources quickly, consider Medicaid's Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) waivers, which can cover aides for daily tasks if they qualify (assets under ~$2,000 per person, after spending down). Programs like PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) provide comprehensive in-home support for a monthly fee, preserving some savings. Start by contacting your state's Area Agency on Aging (via eldercare.acl.gov) for a free assessment—they can guide on low-cost options like adult day care or subsidized home health aides. Consulting a local elder law attorney could help protect their home equity through planning tools like a life estate. Hang in there; resources are out there to help them age in place.",

Exemptions might apply for small gifts to a caregiver child who's provided care for 2+ years, but this requires documentation.
