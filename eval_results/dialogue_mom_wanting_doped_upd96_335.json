General tips include establishing a consistent bedtime routine, like dimming lights and avoiding screens an hour before bed to boost natural melatonin; encouraging daytime exposure to natural light and light exercise, such as a short walk; limiting naps to 20-30 minutes early in the day; and creating a cool, quiet sleep environment. If issues persist, consulting her doctor for underlying causes like medications or conditions is wise.",

Grief and late snacks likely fuel her restlessness, so resist that temptation and focus on grief counseling (start small, like online sessions) while your granddaughter's healthy meals could include evening herbal snacks like banana with almond butter to stabilize blood sugar.
