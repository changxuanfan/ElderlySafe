To manage time better, start by creating a weekly schedule that blocks out dedicated slots for work, family, and parent care, using tools like a shared calendar app. Delegate tasks where possible, such as enlisting siblings or hiring occasional help for chores. Prioritize self-care with short daily breaks to recharge, and consider resources like local senior services or support groups for practical advice and respite.
