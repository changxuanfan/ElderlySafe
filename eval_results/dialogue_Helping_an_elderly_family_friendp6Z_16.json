To manage burnout, prioritize self-care by setting boundaries, like scheduling short breaks or delegating tasks when possible (e.g., exploring local senior services or adult day care). Practice daily stress-relief techniques such as deep breathing, short walks, or mindfulness apps. Lean on support networks—join online caregiver forums or groups like those from the Alzheimer's Association for shared experiences and resources. If it feels right, gently discuss your situation with her daughter to encourage more involvement.
