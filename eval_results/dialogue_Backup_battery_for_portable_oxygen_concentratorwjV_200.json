I've seen elderly folks using these at movies or events, so I'm wondering if there are reliable backup batteries he can switch out on the go?

Yes, Inogen offers official extended battery options for their portable concentrators, like the 8-cell or 16-cell batteries that can provide up to 8-16 hours of use depending on the flow rate. You can purchase them directly from Inogen's website or authorized medical suppliers to ensure compatibility and safety. Always consult his doctor before making changes to ensure it fits his oxygen needs.",

For the Inogen portable oxygen concentrators (like the G3 or G4 models), Inogen does offer official extended battery options directly from their website (inogen.com) or authorized dealers, which provide 4-13 hours of runtime depending on the flow setting and model. These are reliable and compatible without voiding warranties. Avoid third-party batteries on Amazon, as they can be unsafe or unreliable; stick to Inogen's site or contact their support at 1-800-657-0158 for verified sources. If you share the exact model, I can help narrow it down further.",
