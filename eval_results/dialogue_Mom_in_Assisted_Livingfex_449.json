It was overwhelming because I didn't know much about the process. I had to fill out a ton of paperwork, like an inch-thick stack, including details about her assets. They asked for everything she owns, but I only put her social security and long-term care insurance info since I didn't want to reveal more.

If you're concerned about privacy, review the facility's privacy policy.",

For financial disclosures in senior care admissions, facilities typically need enough info to assess eligibility for Medicaid or subsidies without requiring a full asset inventory upfront; focus on income sources like Social Security and insurance, as you did, and consult a local elder law attorney or Area Agency on Aging for guidance on privacy protections under HIPAA and state laws. They can help ensure you're only sharing what's necessary while safeguarding her assets, and many offer free initial consultations to review your situation.",

Facilities typically need accurate financial info to determine payment options and eligibility for benefits, but you can ask them to explain exactly why each piece of data is required.
