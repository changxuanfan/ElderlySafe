For real emergencies (e.g., detected falls or prolonged button holds), it automatically connects to help, but you can adjust sensitivities to minimize false alarms. Charging is hassle-free: it uses a simple magnetic dock that plugs into a wall outlet, taking about 2-3 hours for a full charge that lasts 5 days of normal use—no daily routine needed, and it vibrates or alerts when low on battery.
