Here are a few simple, safe at-home activities to help combat loneliness and keep you engaged: Try gentle chair exercises or stretching videos on YouTube (search for \"senior yoga\" for easy ones); start a small indoor garden with potted herbs or flowers, watering them daily as a nurturing routine; listen to audiobooks or podcasts on free apps like Libby (if you have a library card) for stories or music that spark joy; or journal your thoughts and memories in a notebook to feel more connected to yourself. These can be done independently at your own pace, and they're great for lifting spirits without needing much setup. If you'd like more details on any, just let me know!",

A balanced approach could be setting calm boundaries, like saying, \"I know you're stressed, but that hurts me—let's talk when we're both calmer,\" or seeking neutral support from a trusted friend, counselor, or hotline like the Eldercare Locator (1-800-677-1116 in the US) for advice on family dynamics and potential elder mistreatment.
