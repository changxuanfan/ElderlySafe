She's been paying with a spousal veteran's benefit, a tiny pension, and her savings, but those are almost gone. I live in Texas and can't afford to keep covering the difference forever, and she doesn't want to move here anyway because my place isn't set up for her mobility needs.

Also, check with your local Area Agency on Aging—they can assess her needs and connect her to Medicaid waivers or subsidized housing options. Have you looked into Medicaid eligibility for long-term care?",

In New York State, a great starting point is the New York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA) at aging.ny.gov, which offers resources like the Expanded In-Home Services for the Elderly Program (EISEP) for in-home assistance with daily tasks, and the Community Services for the Elderly (CSE) for non-institutional support such as meal delivery and transportation. For financial help, look into Medicaid's Managed Long Term Care plans through NY State of Health (nystateofhealth.ny.gov), which can cover assisted living-like services in community settings for low-income seniors. Contact your local Area Agency on Aging (find via eldercare.acl.gov) for personalized guidance, or call 1-800-342-9871 for NYSOFA support—they can assess her eligibility without committing to anything institutional.",
