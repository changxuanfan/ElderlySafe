I'm a freelancer working from home, handling most of her daily needs like meals, appointments, and light chores. She's still pretty active and mentally sharp most days, with just occasional forgetfulness, and people often comment on how youthful she looks for her age. Lately, her needs have been increasing, making it harder for me to focus on my work. I'm wondering if there's a way I can get compensated for my caregiving role, even if it's not a full-time salary. Where should I start looking for options like government programs or local resources in Illinois?",

In Illinois, you can start by checking the Illinois Department on Aging (IDoA) website for programs like the Community Care Program (CCP), which provides in-home services and might include stipends or support for family caregivers. Also, look into Medicaid waivers such as the Home Services Program. Contact your local Area Agency on Aging for personalized advice.

In Illinois, start with the Department of Human Services (IDHS) Community Care Program, which offers options like the Home Services Program (HSP) for paid in-home caregivers, including family members, based on financial and medical eligibility (income limits apply). Contact your local Office of Aging or Senior Services for an assessment—find them via the Illinois Department on Aging website (aging.illinois.gov) or call the Senior Helpline at 1-800-252-8966. Also, check Medicaid waivers like the Community First Choice Option for potential compensation. A social worker can help navigate applications, so reach out to a nearby Area Agency on Aging for personalized guidance.",
