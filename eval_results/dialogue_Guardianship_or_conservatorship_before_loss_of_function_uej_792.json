Start with a consistent schedule: gentle wake-up times, shared meals, and short walks or light activities to build structure without overwhelming her.

Encourage social elements, such as morning tea chats, video calls with family, or joining a senior group—perhaps starting small with one activity per day. Prioritize rest with quiet afternoons for reading or listening to music, and always check in gently to adjust based on her comfort. If forgetfulness worsens, consult her doctor for tailored advice.",
