Explore non-profits such as the National MS Society or local Area Agencies on Aging for subsidized aide referrals and respite grants. Consider part-time hires through community postings (e.g., on Nextdoor or senior centers) or hiring certified nursing assistants independently via platforms like Care.com, but always verify backgrounds and skills.
