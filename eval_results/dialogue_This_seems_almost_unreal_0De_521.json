Patience is key with someone elderly navigating loss.",

Start by actively listening without judgment when he shares memories of his wife; validate his feelings to help him feel seen.

Respect his pace—grief ebbs and flows—and consider suggesting professional counseling if he's open, as it can support emotional healing. Small, consistent acts of kindness, like notes or favorite treats, can make him feel cherished and secure.",
