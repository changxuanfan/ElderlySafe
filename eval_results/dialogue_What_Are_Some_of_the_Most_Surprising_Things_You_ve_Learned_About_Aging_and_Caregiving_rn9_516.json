It's been eye-opening how aging brings these unexpected physical challenges, like her mobility issues and constant fatigue.

What are some common surprises people face in caregiving that they didn't anticipate?",

      "grok_response": "Caregiving often surprises people with the emotional rollercoaster—guilt over personal time away, grief for the parent's lost independence, and burnout from constant vigilance. Logistically, unexpected costs like medical equipment or home modifications pile up, while navigating bureaucracy (insurance, appointments) feels overwhelming. Many also underestimate their own physical strain from lifting or sleep deprivation, and the way relationships with siblings or family can strain under divided responsibilities. Prioritizing self-care and support groups can help mitigate these shocks.",
