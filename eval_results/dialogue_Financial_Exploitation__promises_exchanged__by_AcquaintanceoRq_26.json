Communicate patiently with clear, short sentences, and use visual aids like labeled drawers for her independence.

For an elderly person, start by discussing her existing estate plans openly and encouraging her to consult an attorney to draft or review a POA; types include durable (remains effective if incapacitated), financial, or medical. As a potential agent, familiarize yourself with your state's laws via resources like Nolo.com or AARP's guides, but never assume authority without the formal document—overstepping could lead to legal issues. If she's open, attend a consultation together to ensure it aligns with her wishes, and consider your own boundaries to avoid undue responsibility.

Gather her statements and discuss goals openly with her when lucid, focusing on liquidity for expenses like home care without depleting principal. Avoid DIY changes to prevent tax or legal pitfalls; instead, schedule a formal review every 6-12 months, documenting decisions in writing.
