Always prioritize safety and discuss any new routines with your doctor.",

To prevent falls, start with low-impact exercises like tai chi or gentle balance training (e.g., standing on one foot while holding a chair for 10-30 seconds, 3 times a day) to build strength without straining bones; aim for 20-30 minutes daily, but consult your doctor first. For home modifications, install grab bars in the bathroom, remove loose rugs, ensure good lighting, and use non-slip mats in wet areas—consider a home safety assessment from an occupational therapist. Daily routines: Wear supportive shoes, stay hydrated to avoid dizziness, take medications on schedule, and break tasks into smaller steps to reduce fatigue. Regular vision checks and a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D also help; if possible, have a loved one assist with heavier chores. Stay safe!",
