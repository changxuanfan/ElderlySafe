Try speaking in a calm, familiar voice, using their name, and touching their hand or shoulder softly if they're comfortable with that.

For someone with dementia, approach gently with a calm, familiar voice, using simple phrases like \"Hello Blair, it's Chris here\" while touching their hand lightly if they're comfortable with it. Start with low-stimulation activities, like looking at old photos or playing soft music from their past, and keep sessions short (10-15 minutes) to avoid fatigue.
