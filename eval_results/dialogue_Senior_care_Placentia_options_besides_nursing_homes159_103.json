She's mentally sharp but physically slowing down a bit, and she really values her independence. I don't want to push her into a nursing home because I think that would break her spirit and make her health decline faster. I'm looking for in-home help, like someone who could visit a few times a week to assist with groceries, heavier chores, and maybe just provide some companionship since she can get lonely sometimes.

To choose the right one, start by checking reviews on Yelp or Caring.com, verify licensing through California's Department of Social Services, interview multiple agencies to ensure they match her personality (e.g., ask for female caregivers if preferred), and request a trial visit. Always discuss costs upfront, as rates typically range $25–$35/hour, and inquire about background checks and insurance. If needed, local resources like the Orange County Area Agency on Aging (call 714-567-6600) can offer free referrals.",
