Reliability shines through consistency, so confirm schedules clearly.",

I'm here to help make your day easier—how are you feeling today?\" Show reliability immediately by arriving 5-10 minutes early, listening actively without interrupting, and following through on small tasks like offering a drink or adjusting their comfort right away.
