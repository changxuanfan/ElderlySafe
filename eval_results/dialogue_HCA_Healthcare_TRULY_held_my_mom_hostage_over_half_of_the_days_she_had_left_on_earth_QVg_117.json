For an ischemic stroke, they might give clot-busting drugs like tPA within a few hours if eligible. Tests like CT scans are done immediately to rule out bleeding, and MRIs might follow. If it's a larger stroke, they monitor in ICU. Delays can happen due to logistics, but ideally, care starts fast. Have you spoken with her doctors about specifics?",
      "grok_response": "I'm sorry to hear about your mom's stroke— that sounds incredibly challenging, especially with the added complications. Right after a stroke in a hospital, the focus is on stabilizing the patient and determining the type (ischemic, hemorrhagic, etc.) to guide treatment. Typical immediate steps include a CT scan or MRI to visualize brain damage and rule out bleeding, blood tests for clotting factors and glucose levels, an EKG to check heart rhythm, and monitoring vital signs. If it's within the \"golden hour,\" clot-busting drugs like tPA may be given for ischemic strokes, or surgery for hemorrhages. Neurologists assess deficits like speech or mobility, and supportive care like oxygen or blood pressure management follows. If you share more details about her case (without sensitive info), I can help contextualize if standard protocols were followed, but consulting her medical records or a doctor is best for specifics.",

The usual process includes a multidisciplinary team (doctors, social workers, ethics committees) consulting the POA holder for history, preferences, and approvals; if no POA exists, they might seek court intervention or default to surrogacy laws prioritizing spouses then adult children. Delays in imaging like an MRI could stem from resource issues or prioritization, but standard protocol calls for prompt scans (often CT within hours) to guide care.

For stroke patients heading to rehab, hospitals typically coordinate transfers through a discharge planner or case manager who assesses the patient's needs (like proximity to family, specialized stroke rehab facilities) and arranges ambulance or transport services, often prioritizing stability and insurance coverage. Requests like yours on April 14 should involve family input via POA, with written consents and updates before any rerouting; delays or changes, such as to Las Palmas East, might occur due to bed availability or medical decisions, but they require notification to surrogates. To ensure communication during moves, especially for disoriented patients, insist on a detailed care plan that includes contact protocols (e.g., real-time calls from transport staff), a patient advocate's involvement, and HIPAA-compliant updates—document everything in writing and escalate to the hospital's patient relations department if bypassed. If this violated protocols, your POA can help file a formal complaint or seek records to review the decision-making. Take care.",

Social activities such as group therapy sessions, music or art therapy, or video calls with family can foster connection; personalize with familiar items like photos, favorite books, or recorded messages.

Notaries are required to verify a signer's identity (via ID or personal knowledge) and ensure they appear willing and aware, but they're not qualified to assess mental capacity or diagnose conditions like post-stroke confusion; they simply confirm the document is signed voluntarily without obvious duress. If she used stolen ID, that's potentially fraudulent, and stroke-related disorientation could invalidate the POA if she lacked understanding—courts often scrutinize such documents in vulnerable cases. As her established POA holders, you can challenge this by consulting an elder law attorney to review both documents, request a capacity evaluation from her records, and possibly seek guardianship; report the ID theft to authorities too. Protecting her wishes is key—reach out to a local Area Agency on Aging for support. Take care.",
