      "grok_response": "I'm sorry to hear you're feeling this way—after 50 years, it's natural for things to evolve, but loneliness in a marriage can be tough. To reconnect, try small, low-pressure steps like sharing a daily walk or cooking a simple meal together, focusing on listening without expectations. For brightening your day, nurture yourself with hobbies, a short call to a friend, or even journaling grateful moments. If it feels deeper, consider couples counseling—it's helped many long-term pairs rediscover their spark. Hang in there; small changes can make a big difference.",
