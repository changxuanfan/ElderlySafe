Many long-term care policies from that era rely on paper-based processes, so insurers often require formal requests for copies to maintain records. For tips: Always screenshot or print every screen before submitting, keep a detailed log of dates, times, and what you entered (use a simple spreadsheet), and follow up via certified mail or email with read receipts for any requests. If it's a major insurer, check if they have a dedicated claims advocate line to escalate. Hang in there!",
