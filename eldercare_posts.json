      "story": "Together 15 years, married 13 years, he is an awesome husband, dotes on me from head to toes. But there just one thing we just forever unsolve is stubbornness on not want to accept my inheritance help.\n\nMy father whom was a Shanghai businessman when alive own alot of properties, when my parents died they leave inheritance half to me (their daughter) and half to my brother. The inherence is enough to take care of me for the rest of my life not have to work a day.\n\nBack when I got my inheritance, my husband (whom is my next of kin) force me to write a Will that in event of my dead all my inheritance will go straight to my brother, he sees that as the money go back to my Chinese family as it my biological brother. My husband adamant on not want a single penny of it, or anything to do with it.\n\nI got the Wills done as he wish, but it a Will that I wrote against my will just so my husband can be happy or else we just bickering about this.\n\n\\-------\n\nFast forward, 4 years ago his elderly mother (80 years old) had a spinal cord stroke that leave her quadriplegia paralyze (paralyze both arms and legs), she also has alot of other health problems including kidney failure. She went through multiple big surgeries, as well as alot of specialists treating her conditions, and a team of nurses care about her.\n\nHe has been working 84 hours a week, and all his money go to his mother treatments, see specialists, medications, out of pocket cost, and pay for a team of qualify nurses to care for her around the clock as she quadriplegia paralyze (and that alone cost 150K a year).\n\nThree months ago he has to cash out his IRAs with penalty to pay for his mom surgeries hospital bills. The debt collectors were after his mother as it big hospital bills, out of filial he take it on and paid for her debt at the expense of cash out his IRAs with penalty.\n\nHer health recently has turn worst, prolong hospital stays and more specialists treating her, my husband adamant on prolong his mom life as he can, even if it mean he will sale the house to use the money to prolong his mom life.\n\nIn all fairness to him, the house is he bought with his Savings from his working money, I didn't put a penny to the house. I have no problem with him sale the house, as I have my inheritance to take care of me for the rest of my life. I even have a house in Shanghai myself that my grandma leave for me.\n\nAnd yes, I offer to help endless times, I even told him use all my inheritance to care for his mom, but he adamant refused, he even get defensive and shut me out. He said I'm his wife, he is her biological son, it not my job to care for his mom.\n\nI'm at my wits end. I asked him flat out, is he like still hold grudge against my Chinese parents whom discriminate against him because he Sierra Leonean, he not Chinese. My parents till their deaths never accepted my husband.\n\nMy husband said No, and he said if there anything he very grateful to my parents leave their inheritance to me, because he knows the inheritance will financially take care of me, so he can concentrate on financially care for his mom and prolong her life (even if that means cash out his 401ks and IRAs and sale the house to use the money to prolong her life).\n\nHe just adamant not want a single penny help from my inheritance. At this point I told him just do whatever he wants. He can put the house on the market for sale and use that money to prolong his mom life, and I will use my inheritance to rent for the time being, because after his mom pass away, I want him to go with me to China.\n\nHe has the rights to sale the house, he bought the house with his Savings, I didn't put a penny into it. He has no problem to survive without me, he has a Master degree. and makes 6-figures Problem here is for the past 4 years he pour all his working money into his mom medical care and prolong her life. After his mom die he no longer has to pay for her care, all his working money will be his again just like prior to she became paralyze.\n\nOther than the him not want to accept my inheritance issue we don't have a marriage problem, he is awesome, the most faithful loyal man in the 15 years long with him, and he dotes on me alot.\n\nIs there a way to fix this?"

In the alameda county in california and my grandma fell and got a fracture on her hip and its because of that she is right now in senior care center  and shes doing fine except that she cant go use the restroom without having a need for assitance. Also, staff said she would need to be out of care center by next week since they need to open up available beds for incoming patients. Now, my grandma has both Medicare and medi cal but I don't think somewhere like a nursing home would be covered under insurance and it would cost us lots of money since we don't have a whole lot. Any recommendations where she can go and stuff that would be either affordable or something that can be covered under insurance anything helps. Thank you."

She has no prior history of dementia and was previously independent and cognitively intact.  \n  \nDespite rehab and prior hospital stays, her delirium is worsening. Cedars-Sinai classified her case as a “mystery” and was unable to provide further support. We are now seeking your guidance through UCLA.  \n  \nKey notes for quick review:  \n•    Timeline: Onset 8/22, persistent through today  \n•    Current state: Severe, worsening delirium; minimal to no sleep in those 4 weeks; decreased eating  \n•    Prior baseline: No cognitive decline before this event  \n•    Treatments tried: Seroquel, Trazodone, Ativan, Fluconazole (with limited effect)  \n•    Recent tests: waiting on a uti test from the rehab, cedars denied us another test when we were leaving and nothing had been resolved.  \n  \nI would be very grateful for any and all feedback."

      "title": "Need help - elderly man with cancer I help tried to kiss me",
      "story": "Need help navigating this difficult situation. Apologies in advance for the long story.\n\nI am a 51 year old woman, very active in my local theatre community and also a healthcare provider. At an annual theatre camp 3 years ago, I met an elderly couple that took a great liking to me given our shared passion for music and art. Each year at this camp, I have spent short bursts of time with them, but we nonetheless developed a fondness for each other with hugs and sharing nice comments. Last year, they storyed on the group's social media page that the man (I'll call him Remy) was diagnosed with aggressive brain cancer, and this past January underwent surgery and started chemo and radiation. I was very sad when I found this out, and tried to stay in touch with them to keep up with his progress and see when I could plan a visit (my work schedule is very complicated and requires travel). A few weeks ago, I met them for breakfast and the wife (I'll call her Julie) asked that since I had a few weeks off of work while in rehearsal for a show, if I could come to their house twice a week for a couple of hours to take Remy to the park for walks, to the pool to swim and play piano, and that they would pay me. This would help Julie have some breathing room, even though she says he is OK being alone (he is fully ambulatory and cognitively intact, just slightly forgetful and relies heavily on wife for all medical questions/appointments/meds/etc.). I felt very awkward about being paid to help, but she insisted that they value my time, and after I asked her to come up with a number, I eventually agreed to the lowest end of the range she provided. I feel for her as she has said she really needs a break from caregiving, so I felt good that I would be helping them both by doing this, even though I am also taking some classes and am pretty busy during this time.\n\nI started visiting them/him 2 weeks ago, and the 2 hours slowly stretched into 2.5-3 hours given the prolonged goodbyes and him saying each time that he is sad to see me go. Julie is not in the house when I visit (goes to sewing class or brunch with friends), but I have been calling her when I leave to let her know how he felt and what we did, also so she knows exactly what time I depart for the sake of the payment. First visit we walked in the park, then I drove him home. We walked arm in arm for a bit at the park, which I thought was sweet and fatherly. Second visit ended up being a trip to the ER that they insisted on for a mild rash. Third visit he felt fatigued, so he said he wanted to lie down...in his bedroom. We walked to the bedroom, he lay down and after setting down my mug, I said I would go get a chair, to which he replied, \"oh, it's not like I'm going to jump your bones!\" I brushed it off and said matter-of-factly that sitting sideways on the bed would bother my back, and came back with the chair placed at the far side of the bed away from where he was lying. I then brought up a topic of discussion from one of my classes and a video, which we started watching on my phone. This led to my having to sit up/lie next to him to show him the video. He did not do anything weird then. We said goodbye and I left.\n\nThis past week, we went to the park again, and when walking, the arm in arm thing happened again (can't remember if I started it or him), and then he somehow found a way to turn it into us holding hands. I again thought \"oh how sweet,\" but nonetheless felt a bit weird about it (the hand holding was palm to palm, not fingers interlaced). I walked away to use the restroom, and when I returned, he just went and resumed the handhold. I just went with it but still thought it was unusual. We got in the car and left to his house.\n\nWe arrived and I walked inside to see if he needed any last things and say my goodbyes, and after expressing again he was sad I was leaving I went to hug him, and he straight up went in for a kiss (like a wifely peck) on the lips, which I was not expecting. I abruptly turned my face and he landed the kiss on the corner of my mouth. I have been totally weirded out since that day, and now I don't want to go back. I don't want to discuss this in detail with his wife, as it is certain he will probably die in the next few months, and I don't want to create even more strife for her and them, and it's incredibly awkward to even contemplate doing it. I feel like making something up as a reason I can't come around any more and just cutting off contact, all the while feeling bad because he is a dying man. But he has made me super uncomfortable. I have been sexually harassed and also sexually assaulted with a whole lot of trauma in the past, and the more I talk about this, the more I notice that this is causing me seemingly unreasonable levels of anxiety, but I recognize the connection.\n\nAny thoughts and insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance."

      "story": "My mother is an extreme fall risk, and has just moved into more advanced care after falling in assisted living and incurring some serious injuries.  Her first day in the new facility she fell out of bed twice trying to get up. The staff says Texas is a “right to fall”state (their words) and there’s nothing they can do, that even bed rails are illegal. We put big pads on either side of her bed to give her something soft to land on and lowered the bed as much as possible. I still have some concerns and feel just some rails on the bed, not very high ones like the one she had in the , would be helpful to give her some tactile feedback so she can’t try to get out of bed quite so easily. The stuff about bed rails sounds like bunk to me. Is it true? If we end up renting a bed for her, is it legal for us to rent a bed with side rails?"

For now she's in her own home but calls all the time for stuff like \"come hand me my laptop I can't lift it\".....she lives 15-20 mins away lol.

To be quite honest with you all I've told my wife if she brings her into our home I will file for divorce.  Her mom has tried for over a decade to get me out of the picture! I will not allow that in my safe space, especially with a child. \n\nTo the point of the story, she will likely need to go into some sort of facility that can help her with daily tasks and such and we see it happening fairly soon.  She has no saving, only gets the $2000/ month and has Medicare. No assets besides a trailer home with no value.  How can she afford it?  Could Medicaid be awarded as well and kick in to cover it.  \n\nI'm kind of freaking out because I have a sinking feeling she will end up in our home and I know after everything I will have to divorce my SO over it.....like I said it's been really bad dealing with her, the enmeshment etc.  "

      "story": "Situation: 80 y.o. mother sent to rehab facility (nursing home) 3 months ago due to severe cellulitis wounds on her feet & infections. Otherwise healthy. No dementia or disease. \n\nOne foot is 100% healed which is a miracle because they were convinced they’d have to amputate. The other foot is “almost there”. But the doctors never gave orders for her to be fully weight-bearing, so PT has never gotten her out of bed. \n\nIn 3 months she has lost 40-50 lbs. Her dentures no longer fit and hurt her mouth from sliding around. So she hasn’t been wearing them and can’t eat much. They have not put her on a soft diet. \n\nMedicare denied her last appeal and the 100 days has passed anyway. However, I just arrived from out of town for the 3rd time in 3 months. Her last appeal denial was full of lies. For example, it said that her “plan” was to go home with help of family. um? Her nearest family is “me” and I live 900 miles away. \n\nAnyway, the facility convinced her to sign up for a hospice-like plan. SHE IS NOT DYING!!! But apparently it’s some program that will allow them to keep getting paid as they wait for her Medicaid to get approved. \n\nIn the meantime, she isn’t getting any PT or care since she’s considered “hospice”. When all she needs is the PT to help her get on her feet so she can go home. \n\nShe is so depressed. She will lose her apartment when medicaid starts taking her social security check, then she won’t even have the option to go home. \n\nBut how can they just let her lay there wasting away and do nothing just because they are waiting to get paid??? Is this legal? \n\nShe is very low-income and I was just laid off and am currently unemployed. I am in town for a week. \n\nI have already contacted the Ombudsman, I filed a complaint with ACHA (florida), and called APS. The State conducted an “inspection of the facility” which was bullshit. They found “nothing wrong”. Meanwhile I’ve seen roaches every time I have been to visit over the last 3 months and urine on the floor in the hallways. Every CNA is a foreigner and today I witnessed one of them yank an elderly man in his wheelchair in the hallway and slam him into a wall because he was in their way. \n\nNobody seems to care. The facility is only concerned with documenting things to cover their asses. And my perfectly healthy mom is on some facility-based “plan” that’s a combo of hospice and palliative care getting no treatment to help her get home. Since she has been there she has been deteriorating, contracted c. diff. and isn’t being kept clean. Her nails are super long and caked with scum or who knows what. \n\nAlso, nobody contacted me to even tell me they were discussing this hospice crap with her when they had her do the paperwork. This is after I sent the facility an official refusal of nursing home placement 1-2 months ago on my mother’s behalf. \n\nCan a lawyer help us? I don’t want to necessarily sue them for money, I need someone to intervene to give my mother the care she needs rather than letting her lay there to rot. It is affecting her mental health very badly. There isn’t even a clock in her room. It’s a 4-wall prison cell basically. There’s one tv that her roommate won’t share the remote with my mom. She just lays there all day trying to sleep because there is nothing else she can do. \n\n\n\n "

My parents and her and her husband became good friends.  Her kids grew up and moved away, and her husband passed many years ago.  She had always been very self sufficient and independent.  After my dad passed, her and my mom stayed close and talked quite often.  \n\nMy mom passed away in 2020, and I kept in contact with family friend, knowing she missed my mom.  I began to notice how frail she was, and signs of dementia.  Her daughter, her only remaining child, worked full time.  I offered to help her take care of her mother when she needed help, knowing how hard it is to take on the care of an elderly parent, as I had taken care of mine on my own for many years.  I offered to help, and explained how we could split the responsibility between us, and that way it wouldn't be all on one person.  \n\nIt turned out to be completely on me, as she has shown almost no interest in having anything to do with her mom.  Over the last two and a half years I have taken her to all her Dr. appointments, listening to and helping her understand what doctors are telling her, managing her prescriptions and setting up her weekly pill reminders every week, getting groceries for her, been there to help when repair people need to come to her home, sat all night in emergency room with her at times, the list goes on.  I have a lot to manage in my own life as well.  Mind you, I don't get paid and I have never asked to be paid. I've done it because I truly care about her. \n\nShe is now 92, and I've noticed she can no longer comprehend how to pay her bills at all, much less write checks and balance a check book.  I refuse to have anything to do with her finances, I see it as none of my business, and I definitely do not want to be accused of taking anything of hers.  I know her daughter is on her accounts, and she should be the one handling them, and actually, everything else to do with her mom.\n\nI found out that her daughter no longer works, so I asked her to please start taking her mom to her appointments, it's time for her to step up and take over helping her mom, but she refuses to talk to me or help her mom in any way.  I don't know what to do.  It has gotten to the point that she really should not be living alone, actually, it has been to that point for a while.  Thanks for listening, and for any advice.

He can speak and understand, but the action of saying the first few words of a sentence is difficult. Went to see him today, and he's completely confused and forgetful, no idea what's going on, being conversational at a bare-minimum level. He repeated the same questions, wasn't sure about my name, etc. but didn't seem distressed and said he was feeling fine physically.\n\nAlerted the front desk and the nurse doing the rounds; nurse thinks it's his hearing (didn't make a difference when I spoke loudly to him though) and the front desk said it's likely the early stages of dementia (he was perfectly conversational yesterday.)\n\nI checked the meds, Cefepime IV. Possible side effect includes confusion, which means the meds should be switched out immediately due to neurotoxicity that could lead to seizures. I called and tried to leave a message with the nursing supervisor- full mailbox. Tried to leave a text with my phone #. Then called the reception desk and asked if there was anybody who could handle this- I keep being told to call back Monday.\n\nSo I'm wearing myself out with worry. How is there nobody on a weekend at a LTCF? Can he manage until Monday since he needs to be on an antibiotic anyway?? The rapid onset of confusion can't be good for another day and a half.\n\nAnyway my apologies if this isn't the place to story this.\n\nEDIT: Visited this afternoon, somebody came by to check his bloodwork- seemed like they were sent specifically for him, which makes me feel better despite his ongoing confusion. Documented the issue in an email to the county and nursing home.\n\nI'm trying not to panic, if I call an ambulance who the hell knows if the disruption will be worth it- he's not on Medicaid yet and I'm afraid that'll complicate things at the ER.

I want to balance giving them the care they need without being inappropriate.\n\nDoes anyone here know the protocol of exactly how to give an elderly person a bath, especially when it comes to washing intimate and private parts?

      "story": "Hello,\n\nMy mother and sister both had their own aides/respite but because of some conflict; my mom asked if I would move her to our home in another state. \n\nWe did so last week.\n\nI’m trying to hire part time help but my mom is my first experience; so I have no experience.\n\nHer health is declining. My special needs sister CAN do things; she’s just used to my mom pampering her. Because of my mom’s health, she cannot pamper her as much.\n\nMy problems and questions are endless.\n\nWhat is everyone doing for people who *can* do things; they just don’t want to? \nTheir insurance hasn’t transferred yet, so we are having to pay out of pocket for an aide. Not only do I not know how care.com works but I don’t want to have to wait on both of them hand and foot when I’m around. I want someone that helps them be independent as possible. Not enable them to expect me to break myself. \n\nI still have my own kids and my own life. I’m trying to be a good mom and enable my small children to be independent. And here I have 2 grown adults that enjoy me cooking, serving, cleaning, etc . I am worn out. I’m not able to be as attentive to my children.\n\nDon’t get me wrong - I get it - I would love to be pampered too. But I broke down the other day and begged my mom to just help me help herself. She’s in this mess because she let her homeless friend live with her. She’s always trying to help less fortunate but SHE IS the less fortunate for us. \n\nMy husband is great but I don’t want my marriage to fall apart because of any of this. We have diverted thousands of dollars to help her. Anything to make her life easier. We are never in this home anyway, so it’s a good thing to bring them closer to us. He’s currently building them an easier accessible staircase. \n\nBut it feels more like we’re expected to hire help for friendship. I don’t want to have to pay someone to hang out with them. That’s the major reason my husband and I stopped having most of the friends we had; because they only wanted money from us. \n\n\nAny/all advice is welcome. Don’t be rude. \n\nI guess I’m kind of venting too. They can do all of these things themselves… cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc… it’s more difficult for my mom. I don’t want her struggling but it’s just a lot.\nI’m also worried about the hired help. Are they actually helpful? Who knows. What if they try something crazy to make my mom a vegetable that *needs* more care? \nI just don’t trust anyone. \n\nThanks. \n\n\nEDIT: For example, we said it’s ok for her to keep her 3 cats. We’re a pet free family. I’m the one taking care of them. My sister does nothing. So if I don’t do it; then my mom is doing it. I have an extremely sensitive nose; so the smell is awful. One or multiple cats keep peeing in my sisters room/ her clothes. I don’t know why or which one. I want to get rid of the cats. But I want them to have their own home and not make these demands of them . We spent at least $100 just on urine cleaning supplies. We do not ask or demand my mom to pay.  If it were me; I wouldn’t even ask my kids any of this. But I would definitely not have the cats. "

      "title": "Narc HCP sister starving my mother",
      "story": "Hi, I have a mother who's in hospice in her home. She is quite elderly with demetia and doesn't have a lot of time. None of us (two sisters and myself) expected my mother to live this long. My narc sister has total control over her home care as she is the HCP.   I am the only daughter that lives near her and I visit her as much as I can ( 4 days a week to be exact).  My other two siblings live out of state. My mother has 24/7 home care thats provided by a home care agency. Hospice also visits regularly so there are a lot of people popping in and out during the day M-F. On weekends she's with the live in aide but no other health care people visit during that time; that terrifies me.  My access to all these health care professionals is limited because my sister doesn't want me interfering in my mother care. My sisters want my mom to pass as  they are concerned about getting a good price for her house before there's a turn in the economy. My sister dictates exactly what food my mother is given on a particular day and disregards the doctors recommendations for giving her nutritious food on her blended food diet. What I've observed on my visits, particularly in the last month or so, is that my mother is begging me to give her food. She complains of being hungry all the time. My sister has instructed the aides not to let me feed her and they watch me very carefully to make sure I don't. Needless to say, my mom is loosing weight and looks like a stack of bones. My visits have been very stressful. Yesterday on my visit my mother was bringing up clear fluid. At first I thought it might be from indigestion from her dinner as the aide told me she had it just an hour beforehand.  She didn't bring any food up at all and I thought that was kind of strange.  Later on I learned that this is often a sign of malnutrition and undernourishment.  To someone just reading this it might occur to you that I should complain to the agency who provides the aides. I've already done that. The woman in charge tries to avoid my complaints as much as she can. She is very intimidated by my sister and doesn't want to be involved in the conflict. Today I called Adult Protective Services and spoke to them about the situation. Apparently they are reluctant to act on my complaint because there are so many reinforcements in place. APS is very understaffed so they have to be selective on the complaints they follow up on. Realistically, I think my sister would be very successful  in duping them to think my mother's getting excellent care and proving that their practically starving her would be very difficult. The aides keep my mother's home very clean, she has no bed sores, etc., so if they were to show up suddenly at my mom's house I don't think they would learn much. I feel caught between a rock and a hard place, I love my mother and know her time is shortly up, but I don't want her to die from starvation, she deserves a dignified death. So I'm just putting this out there, in case anyone has any ideas of what I can do because I need to act quickly. I don't have time to go through the courts, and I don't even know if I could convince anyone my Mom's being underfed. Many thanks for reading (Too tired to edit so please excuse the typos).  \n\n\n\n\n\n"

She had a crappy life & was very subservient to my narcissistic dad & others, and as a result, me & my brother were her EVERYTHING.

I spent most of my life trying to escape her & my dad.  It was (and is) too much pressure to be someone’s sole reason for being.  \n\nNow she’s 85 & has been cognitively declining since a stroke maybe 5y ago. My dad passed about 3 years ago and my brother, who was severely depressed & has chronic illness, suddenly passed away last month.  Her grief & increased dementia has intensified her fixation on me.  She hates having anyone else take care of her & only wants me around.  \n\nI feel so angry at the world that her life was so unfair, and i have tried to be compassionate and helpful to her, but i just find myself getting impatient with her anxiety and overwhelmed by her intense focus.  It’s really hard, but i do my best to not let that show and to provide the best care i can.  But now, since she’s gotten even more intensely needy, it’s become even more horrible:  i don’t want to touch her or comfort her or hold her hand.  I really can’t stand the way her hands & skin feel.  I hate the smells associated with Eldercare & it’s become hard for me to be around her for longer than 4-6 hours at a time.  I have hired help, and that’s something, but like i said, she only wants ME and gets anxious when she doesn’t know where i am.  \n\nI want to disappear forever.  I feel like there’s something wrong with me and like i just can’t feel love anymore… or don’t want to?  Please explain to me why this doesn’t make me the absolute WORST person in the whole world.

He has been giving her his social security monthly to pay for his expenses, but she wants more.  He is supposed to be receiving monthly payments from the sale of his property for the next 5 years, but no one knows where the money is being deposited.  It is not going into his checking account, which he gave her access to.  Is there a way to figure out where the money is going?

He once sent me a text message from the hospital with it and stating he was giving he Power of Attorney.  I know that isn't legal, but ... it is what I have.\n\nI wish he could tell me what he wants to do, but he just doesn't seem to be able to.  Despite our history, I do want what is best for him and I have no idea what that is.  I don't know if he'd like to stay and work on our relationship and see my kids more often, or whether he wants to go with her.  He once told me that their relationship was just companionship, not a passionate love-based one.  During one of his hospitalizations, she told me that she thought hooking-up with a younger man would give HER a caretaker and here she is doing the care-taking, so I just don't know how attached they are to each other.  \n\nWhat would you do?"

We moved her in with us temporarily with the plan of moving them both into an assisted living facility when my dad is capable of doing so as well.\nNow to the problem I’m having.  Every now and again she will come up with something-anything really-to get mad and cry about, and act like a victim of whatever she is upset about and then come back later asking if she has made me mad, and telling me she is just venting.  If we are visiting my dad, most of the behavior is focused on my dad, he just deals with it, he is an easygoing man.  But when we are at my home, she turns it toward me.  My brother was here visiting my dad and she did the same thing to him, except she directed it towards me and him, and she just cried and got boisterous about it to my dad, who was sitting there witnessing the entire thing.  My brother is a lot like me, so he and I excused ourselves from the room and left out for a bit hoping it would help her calm down.  I struggle with it because I suffer with anxiety and depression.  I’m on medication for it, but it doesn’t prevent me from experiencing it from time to time.  I’m a very sweet person, and I hate confrontation, and “drama”. This last episode of her behavior was when we brought some of her and my dad’s snacks here from their house I just sat them on the dining room table.  But I really just wanted to clean off the table, so I put those things in her room, so they wouldn’t get inadvertently eaten or drank.  Because I really felt if that happened, it would cause her to have another fit.  I was simply trying to avoid that.  \nUnfortunately she still got upset and cried and said if I didn’t want her here, to take her back to her home.  I tried to reassure her that was not the case, but it just made her more angry.  In her defense though, I probably didn’t help matters with me trying to explain why I moved the snacks.  \nThere are so many more times and outbursts from her, I could write a book.  I try to think about all of my actions and words, trying to not cause her fits, but they just seemingly come, no matter how hard I try to prevent them from even happening.  So at this point it feels like I’m having to walk on egg shells in my own home.  \nAll of this to say, I would appreciate any words of wisdom or advice, so I can start to live in peace again.  It’s really taking an emotional toll on me.  Thank you!"

      "title": "Dad is resistant to hospice--help planning?",
      "story": "This is half vent, half desperate cry for help! I'll put some tl;dr action items at the bottom for those who don't want to read all of this. \n\nDad has kidney cancer that has spread to his brain. He's had seven brain tumors, had his brain radiated seven times, had full open brain surgery, and a few weeks ago the radiologist called it: no more radiation, and the oral treatment clearly isn't working. As you can imagine, that much radiation to the brain has had a toll on dad's cognition. He's been losing words and fine motor skills slowly over the course of his fight/treatment, but this last one was devastating. On bad days he has problems answering anything other than yes or no, and his mood is paper thin. The oncologist told us he has \"months, and not many,\" which was clarified to 6 or less. \n\nOne of the two main issues that brought me to reddit is this: dad will not accept what his doctors are saying, and will not discuss hospice care. Right now I live 2 hours away and mom is in the house caring for him. Mom is very fit, but he's over six feet, and we are at the edge of our capacity for what we're able to manage without losing our minds or running away from home. We NEED him to accept hospice in order to access whatever care will come with it. He's close to the point where he needs diapers full time, and mom and I are not up to that level of care for the net six months. We need to pivot to home health at minimum, or a nursing home. \n\nI think we should start looking into nursing homes now. If we got him signed up and start familiarizing him while he's still mostly aware of what is going on around him, the move will be less traumatic when he has no other choice. We could potentially bring him back home for sleepovers so that the transition feels less permanent/final to him. It also, based on my initial research, seems like the most cost-effective option for us. It looks like full-time in-home care is in the ballpark of $7000 a week, although I have no idea if that is before or after insurance, what insurance covers, etc. We're in a suburb of DC, which means we have at least one or two good options near us, but everything is WILDLY expensive. \n\nDad wants to be kept at home until the end, which... I am not sure we can afford. If you all could put the cost of specific services you've used in the comments, it would be hugely helpful for me in Point 2: Mother. \n\nMom is exhausted, grieving, traumatized, and past the end of her rope. She's not willing to piss dad off too much by mentioning nursing homes, and she keeps putting off discussions of in-home daily care (particularly a night nurse, that would be life changing at the moment) or nursing homes because \"we don't need those yet.\" She agrees with all of my points--that his neurological condition is continuing to deteriorate, that we don't want to be totally off-guard when his level of need increases, that we need to know what we can afford... but she will not go into details on this with me because we don't have a jumping off point of \"The cost of X thing is about $$, and you get A, B, and C service.\" Right now it's just her vs inevitable death, and looking up from that is clearly overwhelming her. \n\nI am on all of dad's forms and doctors as someone who can get into his records, pick up his meds, ask questions, etc. It's not that I am not wanted or involved in the process, it really seems like neither of them is able to have a logical discussion about these things because of the emotions it dredges up. \n\nI'm going down for the week at the end of September, and after that will likely be bouncing back and forth between my hometown and current residence. I'd like to make calls/visit places/ask questions when I can, but now \\*I\\* don't know where to start either. Do I call his insurance company and see what is covered and what needs a doctor's recommendation? Do I try to find one of these hospice companies that comes with a case worker and see what they recommend? \n\nIt's been a slow slide since his first cancer surgery back in 2017. We're all exhausted, and this is so fucking sad, but I'm not convinced we can afford to respect dad's preferences here, and I'm just--- AHHHHHH. Why does America/capitalism have to extract every bit of peace, dignity, and money from even our deaths??\n\n  \nTL;DR--\n\n* Please tell me what services you guys have used/will use *and how much they cost*\n* Give suggestions on how to get dad to accept hospice care--he's trying to stick with palliative care every other week despite his oncologist giving him less than 6 months. He's always, even before cancer, been resistant to death talk\n* General advice on getting myself and mom & dad through this new stage"

But everything I do for them needs to be extremely simple.\n\nI am in need of some system that will let a family member type in a message to display on a screen in the grandparents apartment. (Ideally a large one mounted on a wall)  \nIt's intended purpose is to tell them to eat their meals, come upstairs, remind them of appointments, etc. We've tried using an intercom- or calling their home phone - but hearing loss makes that challenging. Having a constant visual reminder would be very helpful in keeping them on track while still living independently.\n\nWould the best setup be a mounted iPad for us to display custom messages on? How would we efficiently send those texts over? My family is even less tech savvy than I am, but we use a Skylight calendar and google home system. "

While we were all in the dining room, a really sweet resident had been sitting all alone, and I saw an empty seat at another table and suggested they might join the group. This resident did that, and all seemed well until I heard a raised voice and behind me one of the young dining room aids was yelling at the resident, telling them that they moved tables and that that was wrong. It isn't wrong, it's totallty fine. The aid's yelling SO upset the resident that they were in tears. They spoke up for themselves a bit, but they were shaken, crushed. I spent time with the resident afterward, offering affirmation, empathy, etc., but what I REALLY should have done was scold the thoughtless aid. I think I'll ask the resident tomorrow when I visit if they'd like to do anything about this. I wasn't sure just how much to stick my neck into it since the resident isn't my relative, but now feel as if not speaking out for the resident was wrong on my part. I know the aid well enough to know that they have a boisterous-ish way of communicating, but there was nothing funny about their words -- they seemed downright mean and insensitive. What's the best way to handle this?\n\nUpdate: I've been thinking about it, and I'm not sure if the aide technically yelled/raised their voice (beyond their normal volume), but I could hear them loud and clear, and the ATTITUDE is what seemed most insulting and hurtful to the resident."

      "story": "First of all I want to thank everyone who gave me advice and kind words on my original story. Thank you very much it’s so appreciated. This is honestly harder on me than when I had cancer because I hate to see my dad so defeated. This all came on so fast, like 4 months tops, it’s been crazy. Before that he was living at home able to take care of all these things on his own. I did help with some things, like driving, etc, but nothing like he needs now. \n\nSo. My dad had been pretty adamant he wanted to go home on Thursday when he was going to get kicked out. I was given the option of sending him home with private pay care, which was not feasible. It was recommended 24 hour care. I’m disabled myself, and besides his house and his income he has no money. Or they said he’d be sent to “long term care”, I immediately apply for MA, and sell his house. Then when MA is approved he goes to assisted living. Idk if the LTC is paid back then or what. \n\nAnyway, as of earlier today he insisted he wanted to go home. I told him fine, but if he needs to go to the hospital again because he can’t get out of bed or he fell he’d be back and have to go in. I told him that toileting was an important part. But he thought he could do it so I called the SW and told him he’s going home and to set up the covered home care (like 4 hours a week with OT, PT and an aide to bathe him). She wasn’t happy but what to do? \n\n\nWell while I was there, he went in his diaper. And he was not able to get to the toilet in time and for whatever reason, whether it’s the brace for the recently broken vertebrae or what, but he’s not able to change the diaper and his pants/shorts and clean himself up. \n\nSo I told him that was a reason right there to not go home. Because he can’t sit around in a dirty diaper for hours until I can come. I explained that it’s bacteria it’s often poop and pee, and it will just multiply and the longer he sits he can get UTIs, sores, etc. The aide came in to clean him and said she usually works nights and that he didn’t know she had to change him 2-3,times a night. Between the two of us he reluctantly decided he would go to LTC. So I called the SW and left an updated message that he will do that so set that up. \n\nSo she’s going to call me Monday, I’m going to go in and start what I need to do after I get a repair taken care of at his home that’s required. I feel terrible that I can’t provide the care he needs. I’d have cancer again if he could take care of himself and go home. But I already live with my mom to care for her even though it’s a lot less. \n\nBut that’s the way it goes. I know he doesn’t want to live like that but he also doesn’t want to sit at home in his mess and getting poop everywhere that I or someone have to clean up. Hope the LTC won’t be the nightmare you hear about sometimes and he can still have some kind of life. I won’t have to worry about being admitted to the hospital because I can’t care for him then. \n\nMy youngest brother just got evicted and moved back in with my dad who raised him. He’s going to have to figure something else out. He works and does his own thing and even made my dad call me when he couldn’t get out of bed when he was THERE, he’d spent the night. Useless. I’m honestly afraid for my life to tell him, he’s bipolar and has made me fear for my and my dads life before, so wish me luck. \n\nThank you again for everything. Not all Reddit is bad, I really appreciate all the support and help. "

My grandmother was receiving domiciliary care, and while the carers themselves were kind, the **communication between me and the care provider was horrendous**. I often felt left in the dark about her visits, changes to her routine, and whether she was being properly supported. They would occasionally cancel visits altogether and inform me after the fact.\n\nIt got so bad that I eventually felt forced to switch providers altogether — not because I wanted to, but because I simply couldn’t trust the flow of information. It was stressful, frustrating, and it made an already difficult situation even harder for my family.\n\nSince then, I’ve been wondering how many other families are going through the same thing. So, I’ve put together a short survey (just a few minutes long) to learn more about these challenges. My hope is to use the results to **explore whether we can create something that gives families clearer, easier access to updates about their loved ones’ care** — all in one place.\n\nIf you’ve faced similar struggles, I’d be so grateful if you could share your experience through this quick survey: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHH69qONG8bVDqzYf8hplGblGcgPC173Ef5MZikLSSaBF-tw/viewform?usp=dialog](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHH69qONG8bVDqzYf8hplGblGcgPC173Ef5MZikLSSaBF-tw/viewform?usp=dialog)\n\nThank you for helping me with this — together, maybe we can push for something better for families like ours.\n\n"

I worked remotely, and I genuinely was willing to move wherever at 24 for new experiences and for our relationship. \n\nHowever, the past two years, I’ve been driving up and back (approx 5 hours) to help my parents out. It’s been tough to say the least while holding down one to two jobs myself. Their situation is precarious financially, so it’s not like I can hire caretakers in-home. I also had to temporarily stay with them three years ago as my mother had a mental health episode that left her hospitalized several times. Unfortunately family in the area isn’t able to support them much and my brother has a baby and lives out of state too so he is not able to assist. As the eldest daughter most responsibilities fell to me anyway for years. My parents named me POA before all this happened. \n\nAfter talking to my husband, he agreed to try moving to IL where I grew up. He will be able to transfer for work. I pray he can get the same shift. I also do have social connections in the area some of which he knows. We will not be too far from Chicago, so for people without kids in their early 30s that at least sounds appealing. He said he likes my hometown area and does like Chicago, but I really never saw him leaving his home state and at that his parent. We’re still young so maybe the change will be good, as long as we can get out of cohabitation quickly. We plan to live with my parents briefly in order to find a new home that fits our budget and needs. I want the best for my husband too, and I feel he is the one sacrificing the most here. He seems a bit despondent even though he hides it well. I just don’t know what to do. I can’t abandon my parents, but I also don’t want to ruin my husband’s life and or marriage.

But essentially told me this is not enough. They told me I should private pay for an hour in the am and the pm. That would cost $6k/ month, more than he makes in a month. \n\nI asked about assisted living. But he doesn’t make enough to private pay and he makes too much to get MA. They basically said I’d have to sell his house then pay for assisted living and when he runs out of money apply for MA which would take months. WTF. I live with my mother because she needs help too and I am in terrible health myself. Helping him is exhausting. \n\nLast time the police came with the ambulance after he fell they told me if they had to come again he wouldn’t be able to live at home. So first I thought I would just bring him myself to avoid that but now I feel like I should call them and when he tells me this then ask him how he suggests I do that. That’s be great if they had the power to get him in somewhere. What if I call the county social worker? I guess on myself for elder “abuse” because who is going to help? What on earth do I do. \n\nBefore this last hospital stay I had to go over 4-5 days in a row because he couldn’t get out of bed in the morning and he had diarrhea and had owed his diaper several times. I had to clean up everything, do laundry every day. I was exhausted. But I can’t not do it, he’s my dad and he can’t just live in his bed in a diaper. \n\nSo what am I supposed to do if I have to wait to sell his house to get him into AL and then he’ll have no coverage and no home after that money is gone (there won’t be a lot after his debt is paid, we had a lot of medical expenses) do I just say fuck it and not pay them?

It is a review of a book my wife and I found very helpful and something I think the people in this subreddit would also find helpful. \n\nI read this for 2 reasons: My local death collective had a read-a-long and I'm helping my wife's mother (90+, dementia (mix of Lewy Body and vascular), diabetes). I'm glad for the read-a-long because it made me accountable even with nutty schedules. And I'm glad I read it. \n\nThe book is in two parts - part one is facilitating a good death, part two is the good death planner. Now, I think everyone should read this book - whether they're a caregiver or not. Why? Because death is part of the process and no one gets out of here alive.\n\nThe first part is something that everyone that's a caregiver should read. Whether it's been 10 years or you're just finding out about what you're getting into. Why? Bluntly, most caregiving roles end in the death of the person you're caring for. This book is very clear and concrete in what a caregiver will be dealing with. It's particularly clear in laying out the symptoms of the most common terminal diseases (that would be chapter 4). Also, avoiding caregiver burnout (chapter 5).\n\nIn part two, O'Brien begins taking the reader through planning for a good death. And this is in all types - physical, mental, emotional, financial and spiritual. These are exercises that I think everyone ought to go through. Why? Because chance favors the prepared mind. Having a plan for how you're going to die and all the things around it (like, who do you want to bathe you?) will make things a lot easier for you and your loved ones. And if you're a caregiver, it isn't too late to discuss this with your loved one. You can at least try.\n\nNow, after reading it I think **The Good Death** is golden for the first part. It's clear and concrete and up front about what's happening. The second part earns silver. It does get into the planning for death, but it feels more like work book than a guide. Still, it is an excellent book and one that everyone should read. Five stars ★★★★★.\n"

      "story": "Im numb.\n\nIve busted by tail to purchase a home for my elderly mom as its what we've discussed for the past decade or more. Weve always been super close and this has been my commitment to her. Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I'd be able to make this happen in this economy and based on my humble beginnings. \n\nMy mom had a stroke in 2023. Recovered but we're definitely noticing personality changes, at a minimum. Much more argumentative and frequently spinning up manipulative banter about how she doesnt need me and that I should leave her alone and allow her to move to a shelter or low income housing. As much as possible, I ignored. \n\nAll the while, my mom continued to join me on open house viewings, and I literally passed up half a dozen homes because they weren't right for her (accessibility, location etc)\n\nThis past winter, I finally found a home that would work because its close to my sibling and nieces home and closed a few months ago. My mom suddenly went distant - she would come look at the house as a stranger. When I explained how we'd start gradually moving her in, she was quiet. She'll stay a few days then go back to her place. In frustration, Ive asked why shes behaving this way given that Ive emptied out my saving to make sure she has permanent shelter of her own. She shuts the conversation down implying that she never asked me to do this!! I decided that Inhad to ignore whatever was going on for my sanity and to avoid a heart attack. So I just let things be for months - she comes over and stays for a few days, then leaves l, as a visitor. She has a cozy room and Ive spent money on modifications to make things more accomodating. The only thing I cant change are 1. Stairs, 2. No shower on first floor and 3. Gas stove (she prefers electric). \n\nJust this week, she asked me a question \"would she be eligible to purchase a home of her own\". I almost lost it but just walked away and pretended to not hear it because I dont want to break down. The lack of gratitude or care! How did it ever get to this point where one is ignoring a HOUSE that was bought for them! In moments where shes complaining she still says things such as \"none of her kids care about her\" or \"she has no one to depend on\". WTF!!! I'm thinking about selling the darn home and leaving the rest to God. Not sure what else to do and Im tired. Truly unbelievable. "

We don't like the current situation, feel that she needs a lot more input, support, and help, but she is very very set in her ways and has resisted all our attempts to get her more support so far. We are both her PAs for Care. She's recently admitted that sometimes, if me and my sister are both away working, she gets very lonely on bank holiday weekends when everyone in her area seems to be away, so there isn't even the normal friendly noise of children, families, workmen etc which provide her with a lot of solace. She's said that she would consider going into respite care for short stays during those empty bank holiday weekends. My initial enquiries have not gone well - many care homes do a minimum of a two week or even a month respite stay, and she's adamant that she doesnt want to \"waste her money\" on longer stays. \n\nI thought maybe she could go on a short break somewhere instead, somewhere where her needs would be met physically but also her companionship needs, but she's said she doesn't want to do a course or learn anything as she's \"full up.\" \n\nI've learned the hard way that trying to persuade her to do anything she doesn't want to do is completely pointless and I want to respect her wishes and help her find what she needs, but it seems that this is a service that is not easy to find. Her needs are 1. safety and security 2. good food suitable for a diabetic vegetarian 3. some minimal physical assistance, but mainly complete independence 4. A community of people to have fun with. 5. Not too far from where she lives (Penge). Has anyone been through something similar or can advise me where to look? Cheers"

      "title": "Siblings don't believe MIL is suffering from cognitive decline",
      "story": "I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for getting my husband's siblings to understand that their 90-year-old mom is probably experiencing symptoms of cognitive decline? Long story short, I had very good reasons to audit her finances earlier this year.  What I found was shocking:\n\nShe made 63 different political donations last year totaling over $2,200. She also made a high amount the previous year, and the kicker is that on one occasion, she intended to make a $25 donation but mistakenly made a $2,500 donation instead.  CNN wrote an article not too long ago about how political parties take advantage of elderly donors, and the examples described in it sound disturbingly similar to what I discovered in her bank statements.\n\nThen there were the $6,000 in donations to 60 different charities, some of which are ranked among the worst in the country.  I put her on the DMA Opt Out List, but that doesn't cover entities she has done business with, so I have personally contacted 145 different non-profit and political organizations to request that she be removed from their mailing lists.  I think this issue snowballed over time, because what I have learned is that when a person gives to one charity, that charity turns around and sells their mailing list so now that person will be getting solicitations from more charities, and then they will give more money to more charities and end up on even more mailing lists.  I am well aware that when an elderly person starts donating to charities that they have never supported before, it could be an early warning sign of dementia.\n\nShe has three different risk factors for dementia.  My husband has been trying to get her to see her doctor for a cognitive assessment, but has not been successful thus far.\n\nMy mother-in-law now understands that her political and charitable giving got out of control, and she has been sending back unopened envelopes, but the fact remains that her judgement is often lacking.  For example:\n\nShe spent $2,000 dollars last year to have some crab grass ripped up and replaced with new seed.  The problem is, it was the end of the summer and the frost would have killed off the crab grass within a matter of weeks.  The salesperson should have put her down for a crabgrass treatment in the spring, but probably saw an easy mark.\n\nAround the same time, she spent $5,000 to have hundreds of pounds of perfectly fine stone mulch hauled away and replaced with wood mulch.  When I asked her what the $5,000 landscaping bill was for, she couldn't remember.  When I called the company and had them send an itemized list of charges, she said she must not have bothered to look at the price before signing the contract.\n\nWhen we discovered the excessive lawn and landscaping charges, we talked to her about how they were not really necessary, but she apparently forgot this.  On Mother's Day this year, I thought it would be wise to ask her about her lawn care plans for the season, and she said she was going to have her lawn care company come out and rip up more grass because there were a few bare spots in the lawn.  She said price tag on this little project was \"over $1,000.\"  We convinced her not to do it, and my husband came over and put down some grass seed for well under $100.\n\nShe also has problems writing checks.  She ends up throwing away 15% of the checks she writes because she \"makes mistakes\" when writing them.  We are glad she catches most of them, but how much longer can we count on her to continue catching her own mistakes?  We did get her bills set up on autopay, so that should at least minimize this risk.  Again, I am well aware that difficulty writing checks is an early warning sign of cognitive decline.\n\nI should also note that she recently told me that my late father-in-law always handled their money and she knows nothing about finance.  That would probably explain why her discount financial advisor's decisions have resulted in her paying a total of $56,000 in largely avoidable capital gains taxes over just two different tax years.  My husband and I have started attending calls with her financial advisor with her.  My husband knows very little about finances and has to lean heavily on me during these calls.\n\nWhen my husband brought these issues to the attention of his brother, he said he was her power of attorney but that he \"struggled to manage his own finances.\"  He offered no help.  We brought up the possibility of cognitive decline with him.  We showed examples of his mom's issues and we cited reliable sources, but we don't think he believed us.  When my husband discussed this with his sister who lives six hours away, she said that their mom \"has always been altruistic\" and so her excessive charitable donations are \"fine.\"\n\nMy husband recently convinced his mom to give him power of attorney, but since he knows very little about finances, his responsibilities are falling heavily on me.  He is trying to learn and I am even giving him hands-on training exercises, but I have significant experience doing corporate training and I know that his financial knowledge won't come overnight and will slowly grow over time.\n\nHis brother and sister are not helping.  And why should they?  Their mom is still driving and living in her house, so that means everything is fine, I guess.  I should also note that I have multiple relatives who have lived into their 90s and beyond, so I am well-versed on issues related to aging.  That has not been the case in my husband's family, and his mom has lived the longest of anyone.  Therefore, my husband does not recognize other, subtle signs of aging until I point them out.  I suspect his brother and sister are in the same boat, and any feelings of denial they might be having are just making it worse."

In her case; country living - going to the outhouse, spittoons, chasing mules, daily chores of feeding chickens, riding to town on horses or emptying the chamber pots as a morning chore. I have been humbled by the stories and in eager anticipation, I prepare to hear more when I again get a glimpse of yesteryear through the eyes of my aged mother. "

      "story": "My father has been caring for my grandmother since his father passed away. This was over 20 years ago. She was diagnosed with dementia about 1 year ago. It’s been on a decline since. My problem is, my grandma has been verbally abusing my dad for years. She’s always resented him, God knows why because if it wasn’t for him she’d be out in the streets or dead. His siblings refuse to help him. He’s been carrying the emotional toll of having to be her caretaker because she was a “stay at home wife” for her entire life. He hasn’t been able to have a life or a significant other because of the money and time it takes to take care of a parent. \n\nMy worry is that she’s been threatening him lately and verbally accosting him and my siblings, accusing them of stealing her things, etc. She has Medicaid and we were hoping to have her in a home so that she’s not alone all day and upset for being alone all day. We can’t afford it though. Does anyone know if Medicaid helps with the cost of assisted living? The cheapest ones I find are around $4,000 and just goes up from there. "

We're talking about things like helping her with a grocery run, doing some of the heavier chores around the apartment, and maybe just sitting with her for a while so she has some company. She's pretty particular about who she lets in, but I'm hoping to find an agency or a service that specializes in that kind of companion care.

      "story": "**Background**\n\nI believe my dad’s friend, who is also a senior, is taking financial advantage of my dad. Recently, and out of nowhere, my dad became aggressive. This is not my dad’s normal behavior. Long story short- he wanted to kick me out of the house (we co-own) so “he can rent out the rooms and die.” Before he asked me to leave, my partner own a condo where we were going to charge $500 to cover HOA and electricity; we’d cover the rest, but his so-called friend John could not stay there. This is how it all started.\n\nA bit of background about the house: My father and I have shared title for over 20 years now, ***joint tenancy with right of survivorship***, and the home would pass to the grandchildren (which has been and is the plan). My dad cannot afford the mortgage, and he isn’t capable of doing the things necessary to find tenants and hold them accountable, so when I said no, he said he was going to take me to court. This was the first time in my entire life that we stopped talking for two months.  \nThen out of nowhere, my dad's “friend” John called and said that my dad was in the hospital and that I needed to TAKE care of him. I rushed to the hospital and saw my dad had lost a lot of weight, and he looked awful. I asked my brother to watch over him for a month or two so that we could get things settled in our home state (I found out he was couch surfing). I bought our tickets and we flew over. When we arrived, I explained to my brother my suspicion of substance misuse (benzos) and predatory behavior around people my dad calls “friends”. *Note- my dad had never abused his meds until recently.*\n\nWhile I was there with my brother in a different state, his “friend” John called, and I answered, and he asked for the deed to the house. I asked John why the attorney was contacting him and not my dad. He said, “ I think she thinks I am your dad.” I responded, “Well, obviously you're not, and I told him to advise the attorney that she was corresponding with the wrong person. (My dad had already called the attorney to let her know that he wanted to cancel the suit 3 days prior.)\n\nDuring that time, I found out my dad had taken out a restraining order against me and that the attorney charged him $5000 plus another $1000 for who knows what. I asked my dad if he had taken out a restraining order, and he said yes. I asked him if he knew what it entailed, and he replied that he did not. My dad said that John had told him that my brother and I hated him.\n\nLater today, my brother said that my dad asked the attorney, “Please talk to my son,” but the attorney said it was not necessary. We are concerned because this is a snippet of some of the things she texted\n\n* She doesn’t recall how much my dad gave her\n* She explained that she had done the work (we asked for an itemized list), but there was no response\n* She said she should have taken better notes...better notes of what and that she trusted him????\n\nI submitted an APS report regarding my concerns about the predatory financial abuse, but the report was closed since he isn't in our home state. This was the second call to APS. The first was in June when my dad stopped talking to me.\n\n**Question**\n\nDue to my father’s cognitive decline (he’s 84 years old) and possible benzo misuse, do you think it is possible to ask the attorney for a refund of my father’s money? I believe his friend was trying to get my dad to refinance the house in someone else's name and sell it. His friend John is also a broker.\n\nI hope this makes sense. I would appreciate any help you can provide."

Her ID, phone, and wallet never made it to the hospital. A police report was filed, but there’s been no follow-up.\n* She didn’t receive an MRI or clot-busting medication for days. We were later told she had a second stroke before the MRI was even performed.\n* On April 14, we arranged for her transfer to Las Palmas West Rehabilitation Hospital. Instead, she was rerouted to Las Palmas East, nearly 20 miles away, without explanation. The ambulance was turned away from West and sent to East. No one has accounted for the hours she spent in transit.\n* The average rehab stay is 10 days. We were actively planning her transfer to a new facility when, out of nowhere, Las Palmas East stopped communicating with us. They told us she had “no family” and refused to discuss her care or discharge.\n* On April 29, after we left El Paso, the niece of her deceased fourth husband (Annette and Carlos Sanchez of Mesilla Park, NM) took a notary named Ivonne Aguirre and our mother’s ID—which had previously been reported stolen—to execute a new medical and general power of attorney. We were not informed. We have an active complaint against this notary with the Texas Secretary of State’s committee for civil penalties.\n* The facility decided, despite having access the entire time to medical documentation showing she lacked the mental capacity to consent, that they would follow the new power of attorney. Their legal team claimed they had no choice.\n* In May, we tried to correct the record. Our own notary refused to proceed because our mother was not oriented and could not legally consent.\n* Las Palmas East kept her for 54 days—more than half of the 100 Medicare-covered days she had left. We were never consulted about discharge planning or care decisions.\n* When we opened an APS case to challenge the POA and advocate for her rights, the facility obstructed the investigation by refusing to release records. What should have taken one day dragged on for over a month.\n\nThis wasn’t just a bureaucratic failure. It was a betrayal of trust, a denial of rights, and a system that allowed a vulnerable woman to be isolated, misrepresented, and stripped of her autonomy.\n\nWe are asking for stronger enforcement of medical POAs, transparent hospital transfer protocols, and accountability for facilities that misrepresent patient status.\n\nWe’re not giving up.

My mother is elderly (70 years) with lots of health issues- TBI, well controlled temporal lobe epilepsy, COPD, severe spinal issues that have given her difficulty moving around. She is on oxygen for her COPD and is a long term smoker. My father is 65, disabled due to severe heart disease along with his own host of other issues including COPD, kidney failure and need of a knee replacement, scheduled for next week.\n\nOur situation now starts 5/6 months ago; my parents had been suspiciously no contact (they are usually constantly calling me for help) and when I went to check on them my mother had an injury to her face. She tried telling me it was from falling but very clearly was a burn- she forgot to turn her oxygen off and caught her tubing on fire while smoking. It wasn’t too severe, but definitely not great. I was furious and told my father how unsafe it was. No, she learned her lesson, it’s fine. A few weeks later my father called me to say that she was in the emergency room with 3rd degree burns on her leg from toes to knee- she smoked with oxygen on and caught fire again. She refused to go to the burn unit as recommended and has been in hospital/rehab until very recently. She is unable to get up unassisted (and needs lots of assistance when she does- typically more than one person). No one thought it was safe for my mother to go home- not elder services, not the hospital, not the visiting nurse, not myself. But she lied and manipulated my father into thinking she’s better than she is. They have aides for a few hours a day- when my mother doesn’t throw them out. My mother is constantly having urinary and fecal accidents- in fact, she doesn’t even try to get to get to her commode. It’s at the point where my father doesn’t even close her diaper because it’s easier to change her without. She is constantly calling him for something- a cigarette, soda, to clean her up. He can’t rest at all and looks like absolute hell. He is now admitting that he can’t care for her. He is very afraid that one or both of them will get hurt. If he does not immediately respond, she becomes violent, throws things, etc. She has called and reported him for abuse and neglect many, many times over the years- myself as well, which is why I am not more involved. I will no longer put myself in that situation. Her visiting nurse tried to have her sent back to the hospital on Saturday because they are nit safe. The ambulance could not take her because she is “oriented”. I was advised to consult her doctor’s office who also said that she is oriented and they are unwilling to give the order. Do we have any options for help? She is completely reliant on care from others. My father is having surgery next week and will be in the hospital for at least a few days. He will not be capable of caring for her after his surgery either. Thank you for reading."

The attending physician said to make an appointment to have the GP recommend private physiotherapy while we queue for Home Care services. This way, he said, he will be able to get up to 5 subsidised sessions. That's all he said. \n\nDoes anyone know if this is true? Is it a payment that we manually claim for after each session?

I live in California and don’t have the resources (financial or time off) to go see her very often. My brother lives in Minnesota and isn’t able to go see her very often either.\n\nMy brother and I both are really concerned about her continuing to live on her own, especially when she keeps herself so isolated from other people. We know she’s really lonely. And she has shared concerning information with us, like sometimes she takes too much of her pain meds, she’s walking less than 500 steps a day and has stopped her physical therapy exercises completely, and she is starting to make some financial mistakes that are costing her a lot of extra money. It’s obvious that she’s having some memory issues as well. Plus, the house she lives in really is designed for people without mobility issues and she has to navigate some stairs each day just to get to the bathroom and the kitchen.\n\nThe problem is that she has absolutely refused (for decades at this point) to make any changes to her life. She doesn’t want to move or consider alternatives like assisted living, she doesn’t want us to help her with her money issues, she doesn’t want to do anything but keep her life the same as it’s always been. She refuses to talk about making changes. But she also cries a lot and talks about how lonely she is.\n\nWhat is to be done in this situation? I’m so scared for her because it’s just not safe for her to be living on her own anymore but she won’t choose anything different. My brother wants to move her to Minnesota so he can look after her. I know I’m absolutely not in a place to be able to take care of her as I have three kids and a husband with health challenges. I can get down to Texas for a short while to help her - but I don’t feel right just leaving her alone anymore.\n\nThank you for any advice/insight you have."

      "title": "A Plea For Help",
      "story": "Hi everyone. I apologize for how unorganized this is. I am at a loss and desperately want to feel like I have tried to help my grandmother in every way that I can. If this isn't the right place, please just tell me   where you all think I should ask.\n\nMy grandmother raised me after my mother and father died when I was 11. She worked two jobs to take care of me. She scrubbed floors to help collect money so I could go to University - the first in my family. I went to law school after and have been lucky enough to be very successful in opening up my own business. My point in saying all this is that I owe her everything in my eyes. \n\nMy grandmother stayed in rural North Carolina after I left. I never moved back, and my grandmother for the most part was taken care of by my aunt. About a year ago, my grandmother's legs began to weaken and she had difficulty walking by herself. She was otherwise her normal, wonderful self. \n\nThis January, my aunt made the decision with grandmother to try a surgery that may help her due to some difficulties with her spine. I don't know the name of the surgery or the medical condition exactly. I should have learned this information and been more involved. Her surgery initially went fine. But 24 hours after, she lost feeling in her legs and became paralyzed. She is on medicare and medicaid and the hospital she went to did not seem to want to help with any long term physical therapy. \n\nIn February, my grandmother was moved to a nursing home in a very rural part of North Carolina. This nursing home was notoriously bad and acknowledged by everyone as bad. I desperately wanted to get her out of there, and to my great happiness she agreed. I then spent 3 months trying to get the nursing home to even answer my phone calls, over 90 missed calls and messages and nothing. \n\nDuring this period, my grandmother developed blisters on multiple areas of her body. I recognize that bed sores happen during long term care, but my understanding is that these are mitigated by moving a person around, especially one who is paralyzed. However, this was not done. At all. It seems that the facility never really moved her, and wounds developed and festered on her back and her foot. They blackened and developed gangrene. I've never been so revolted and angry as when I saw the photos - these were huge wounds. They finally ended up admitting her to the hospital in June, but by then it was too late. She had surgery to remove the necrotic tissue on her back which helped, but they amputated part of her foot. \n\nMy grandmother is now in another facility. It's better, but it's still below where I wish I could get her. When I saw her this week, she was in severe pain. Seeing her like this was like ripping out my heart. I love her more than anything and I am desperate to try to do something, anything. \n\nI feel like I've been vague but have also written too much and don't want to waste people's time. I am willing to accept that the surgery wasn't botched due to negligence - I'm an attorney, I understand that things can go wrong despite best efforts. But my family has little or no information on this and I simply don't trust what happened. Beyond that, the negligence of the first facility is staggering. \n\nI want to have an independent physician or someone come in to see the wounds and tell me what I can best due to take care of her. I don't care about the cost. And I should say this - I'm not LOOKING for someone to blame. I just want to know that I did all I could. If this happened due to accident, or just life being life, then fine. I'm willing to accept that. But I owe it to her to try to look into things, I just don't know what to do. \n\nI hope I'm making sense. I'm writing this in a heightened emotional state and just trying to get it out. Does anyone have thoughts on where to begin, or what I should do?\n\n"

      "story": "I have power of attorney over everything for my mother. She has gotten scammed so many times, she thinks that Kevin Costner is trying to send her $1 million, then she thinks that the lead singer of some band who’s in like his mid 20s is her best friend and he wants to come spend the Fourth of July with her, Then she thinks that some famous opera singer from Italy is her fiancé, it’s bad. The second time she got out of the hospital was this last April, and before I was able to get her debit card back from her, she lost $600 on a TikTok scam. Somebody got her debit card number and took $600 out of her bank account on TikTok items. We were not able to get the money back. So at that point we got her fourth new bank account and debit card number (in the past three years bc of scams), and I took the debit card and I changed her bank account login username and password. And I have complete control (up until then I paid her bills, but she still had her debit card and bank login info). \nShe’s having a really hard time with it. She doesn’t understand why she can’t log into her bank account and see what she has in there. I tell her it’s because she actually gave someone her username and password and so we can’t trust her with her username and password. She says she wants to know how much money she has in the bank. I tell her she has $31, but her life insurance policy is about to clear so that’s gonna put her overdrawn by 20 or so dollars and result in one overdraft fee. But if she actually had her debit card number right now she would place an order on Walmart or Kroger. She’s also currently caught up in some scam with a fake Italian opera, singer, and she wants to send him $200, either that or she wants to send money to an orphanage in Italy, I can’t figure out which is the actual truth on that one. But if I give her back control of her stuff, she’s going to spend everything. She’s going to give it all away. She’s not going to be able to pay her homeowners insurance and she will lose her house. Or she won’t pay her life insurance policy and when she does finally pass, I won’t be able to afford to do anything with her body, other than abandon it. She won’t be able to pay her lights and they’ll get cut off, or her cable, or her cell phone, the list goes on and on. Because she will spend every single penny she gets on things that she doesn’t need.\nShe is broke, as a large portion of elderly people are, and she lives paycheck to paycheck, and doesn’t always have enough money to pay her bills and buy groceries and buy her medication‘s. And I can’t give her back access to her bank account. She has proven time and time again that I cannot trust her. And she says that she is 74 years old and she’s done it for decades and she should be able to do it now. She doesn’t understand that she can’t. She doesn’t understand that she’s not the same person that she was 20 years ago. And I can’t make her see that.\nAnd I’m really sorry that this is so long, but I don’t know how to tell her that I can’t trust her with her own money. I don’t know how to explain to her that not giving her back control of her bank account is in her best interest. Because it is. But she doesn’t get that. I tried explaining to her that our health insurance has gone up $300 a month, and that our car insurance has gone up $150 a month because our 16 year-old is driving now, and we don’t have any extra money to help her if something goes wrong. I don’t think she understands that. We literally will not be able to help her if she screws up her bills. And we literally do not have enough room in our house for her if she loses her home. We are four people in a two bedroom house with two dogs and two cats. She could sleep on the couch, but that’s the only space we have, and our couch is broken. And we could not take her dogs. I mean, I was asking her to check her Gmail, she wanted a personal private Gmail set up and so I set it up on her phone (I know the password and check it here at my house, she’s been using it to talk to her scammer opera singer, but she doesn’t know that I know), but I told her to check her Gmail and she said she didn’t know how to do that. I told her it was on her phone, and she said she had no idea what I was talking about. I told her I set it up with her together a month ago on her phone and that it’s right there on the front of her phone and she didn’t know what I was talking about.\nShe called me three weeks ago and told me she was so glad she could get in touch with me because she didn’t know how to use her phone anymore. And she wants her bank account information back? She wants to pay her bills? \n"

Remeron 15 mg, Zoloft 75 mg, Buspar 20 mg. She struggles with coordination like feeding herself etc in these drugs. They ask her and she says yes. It makes me mad.

I am in a whole other part of the country taking care of my husband’s elderly parents, one of whom just passed a few weeks ago. Most of my dad’s multiple hospitalization have been from him taking medication in improperly. My mom had fallen twice in just the last week. My dad had altered mental status from encephalitis from the immunotherapy treatment. I have been following things closely and spending hours on the phone each day. He was discharged recently from the hospital after 16 days inpatient. All kinds of medications were changed. He was discharged from rehab after a week stay. Somehow, no one at the house with him- 4 other adults- checked the rehab notes and haven’t been giving him any of the he new medicines.  When you couple this with the clinic notes that he is severely protein and calorie malnourished, I am devastated. He deserves so much more than this. I feel better when I can “check things off a list.” What kind of system could I put in place to ensure he is cared for appropriately? I am going to push for a move to assisted living. But, they are stubborn. And, the other adult would have to get a place of their own, which would be good since they are not contributing financially. What should I do? Help!

She has had 24/7 care in her home of 50+ years as was her stated wish before she became incapacitated.\n\nA month ago, she was taken from her home by her son and placed in a 10-bed care home in another state, one not licensed for dementia care. The son refused to tell us where she was or whether she was ok. He has no access to her medical records or providers at home, so we have been worried about continuity of care. We finally found her last week.\n\nAs you can imagine, this whole mess is in court in both states, but the judges don’t want her moved without assurance she is medically able, so she’s staying where she is for now.\n\nAdult Protective Services has reported to us that she has been prescribed the following psychoactive medications since arriving at the care home, all from a nurse practitioner who would have no access to prior medical records:\n\n- Lexapro/escitalopram 10 mg daily\n- Keppra/levetiracetam 50 mg tab every 12 hrs\n- mirtazepine 7.5 mg daily morning (discontinued: 2 15 mg tablets daily dissolved on tongue + can give one extra as needed)\n- Seroquel/quetiapine 20 mg day as needed (liquid?)\n- Seroquel/quetiapine 20 mg (liquid?) bedtime (replaced 100 mg tablet at bedtime)\n- Seroquel/quetiapine 50 mg each morning & afternoon \n- trazodone 100 mg 2 tabs bedtime (2 tablets 100 mg each, or 2 tablets 50 mg each for a total of 100?)\n\nOf these, only the Lexapro and Keppra are medications prescribed by her **actual** doctor, a geriatric specialist who has been her doctor for 10+ years.\n\nWe figured she would have to be drugged to get her out of the house and for travel, but I was imagining Valium, not this.\n\nAm I right in being freaked out and considering it elder abuse, that the only benefit is to facility staff making Annabel more manageable?\n\nI want to report the facility to its licensing agency and the NP to theirs.

She has not been responsible and she loves money, so my parents won’t appointment her. I’m helping my parents but not officially POA. My parents are scheduled to move back to their house after being a memory care facility for a few months. They ended up there due to medical help for my dad rather than memory challenges (although his memory is gradually getting worse). They were the healthiest people in the facility, so it was too much too soon. But I was notified by the facility that an ombudsman from a legal aid organization interviewed my parents at my step sister’s request. I don’t know if that is really why this interview happened. But now I am even more concerned about ensuring that we have the appropriate care at home for my parents.  I wanted to set them up with 24 hour care for the first few weeks to ensure a smooth transition and we could scale back. But my parents refused to pay for that level. We have 4 hours per day, 7 days a week. Now I am concerned this ombudsman from legal aid will check on them at home and they won’t have the appropriate care. Any ideas about my liability in this situation? My parents are not cooperating and I can’t ensure they won’t fire the workers later. My step sister seems intent on making trouble and I’m concerned about my liability of being in the middle.  There are several issues. It’s possible the facility is using a scare tactic with me.  My sister might be planning some way to gain POA.  I’m starting to think my parents would be better off in a facility because they can’t say “get out of my house” or forget the amount of help that they need, bringing negative consequences to themselves and to me.  Do I need to be concerned about being accused of elder abuse or elder neglect? If my parents need more help, would we be advised of that so we can remedy it or would consequences just come. It’s a heightened concern due to the step sister who seems intent on sowing as much chaos as possible."

      "story": "I am currently living with my father who is in his late 60s and delusional as hell. He is in poor health due to life-long overindulgence and has no money. I moved in last November after his 90 year old neighbor called me concerned that he was sitting in his home with no electricity. He had been siphoning some of hers off via a single extension cord plugged into her outdoor outlet. I dropped everything and moved myself, my cats and my bf (now ex) in to help. Not necessarily out of love for my dad but because this is my grandmother’s home and I couldn’t stand by and let him ruin it. \n\nThe last 8 months have been hell. I walked into a house with a million different problems, all seemingly small fixes that have been exacerbated into larger/more expensive problems due to his negligence. Most pressing are holes in the roof (in two of the upstairs bedrooms including the one he sleeps in) something he has “fixed” with pieces of plywood and buckets to catch rain and debris that falls through on stormy days. \n\nMy dad has not been working for over a decade, essentially living off the funds my grandmother was able to bring in (from her social security and savings) or whatever few dollars he’s “borrowed” from friends and relatives (I’m included in this). When my grandmother passed in 2020, he was essentially on his own to handle the home (whose ownership was now his by default of being the oldest son) and he has done absolutely nothing to maintain this very nice home he was gifted. \n\nI came in on a mission. I found about some grant money and other federal programs from the government specific to roof repair and presented him the paperwork to fill out. I got all the utilities caught up or switched over into my name (which were THOUSANDS of dollars behind). My ex and I tried to clean and clear out the clutter.  I took out my annuity, filed my taxes early, picked up whatever temporary work I could find and poured EVERY dollar I had to pay bills and keep us afloat. \n\nHe in turn created obstacles every step of the way. He would stop us from throwing things away out of sentimentality (it’s all crap). He ignored deadlines and my request for him to start the paperwork (that he had to complete as the homeowner, I could not be the one to start the process) to sit and watch action movies and westerns on my fairly new television (that I barely used at my apartment bc I was WORKING all the time). While my ex was here, my Dad was often nasty to me and would say things like “I can’t wait till you move out” or “This isn’t her house until I die”. He built a friendship with my ex (who is a POS) and used him to try and ice me out of important decisions about the house including his almost daily use of my car (the only operating vehicle in the household). He would instigate fights between me and my ex and stand by as my ex would yell at me in front of him. \n\nI broke up with my ex a couple of months ago and now the energy has shifted. My Dad has suddenly decided to be nicer to me and work with me. Not actually take control of anything but will show up when I’m already doing the work and pretend to help. He is just starting to see how bad the situation is - me out of work bc this goddamn economy and us having no money bc he’s a loser who has sapped every resource dry - and now wants to be proactive about getting applications filled out and working on the house. \n\nWell we have missed all the deadlines for help by now. Any help I found back in November is no longer an option. He refuses to collect Social Security because he is adamant that he will be “going back to work soon” as a life insurance agent. Meanwhile, whatever money I have been able to scrape up is all but gone atp. \n\nI am doing my best to stay positive but things are so far gone that I can’t even dig up enough money to leave this hellhole like I want. I came here with good intentions and my dad has spit in my face repeatedly. It seems like his only goal was to sink the ship with me in it and now he’s getting his way. I can’t even get out of bed these days. I cook to survive and feed my cats. I have no motivation anymore to try even though I know I’m the only thing keeping the lights on and us alive. \n\nI hate to say this but it would be better if he just died already. Or went away to a nursing facility. But he’s not sick enough to have someone take over legally or be committed against his will. So it’s a waiting game. I’m so depressed. I never thought my life would turn out like this. "

      "title": "Sister hiding elderly mom’s whereabouts - how can I find her?",
      "story": "Hi everyone, I really need help. Ever since my dad passed away, my relationship with my sister and elderly mom has gone downhill. My sister is a greedy and cunning woman, and has taken full control over my mom (in her 90s and mentally sound but has no backbone) slowly isolating her, and eventually cutting her off from me and the rest of our family. My sister got access to my parents’ finances, put her name on their accounts, and blocked my mom from communicating with anyone in the family. This has all the signs of elder abuse.\n\nRecently, I learned through another relative that my sister moved my mom out of her home and into a “rehabilitation center.” But my sister wouldn’t give any details (address, contact info, or reason for the move). It’s been weeks, and I don’t know where my mom is, or even if she’s still alive. I suspect she may actually be in an assisted living facility near my sister, but I can’t confirm either. \n\nI called APS to investigate the situation. They got a hold of my sister who gave them the phone number to whatever facility my mom is currently at. My mom answered and claimed she was doing fine. However I suspect it was a script my sister made her rehearse. APS said since my mom said she was fine and seemed well taken care of, they couldn’t do anything, nor could they release the phone number or location of my mom. \n\nI’m at a loss right now. How can I find out where my mom is? Is there a way to search for her in rehab/assisted living centers or confirm if she has passed away? I know facilities won’t just give out info, but I don’t know what other ways there are to find out where she is. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. This situation is very stressful and I’ve never dealt with anything like this before.\n"

She’s not responding to stimuli except pain. She did very briefly turn her head to look at me for a second when I was talking to her. \n\nWe live a few states away but visit once a month. Except the last couple months there was a pause on visiting as I recovered from surgery. We were coming to visit the next day anyway and I got a call about her going to the ER. \n\nIn the hospital the nurse showed me a pic of the necrotic bedsore. That and a horrible rash that almost looks like burns between my mom’s legs. I was shocked. The facility had called me to get permission to treat a wound on her back and I said yes. I had no idea it was this bad. The nurse at the hospital said the only way it could’ve gotten that bad was negligence and I need to keep a better watch on her. \n\nSince it was the weekend I didn’t get to speak to any of the facility admin staff. I’ll be calling tomorrow but I’m not sure what to do. It’s a good facility. I can’t find any complaints. There’s a waiting list to get in. My dad is there as well and he’s very happy there. \n\nMy mom has dementia and she’s type 1 diabetic with uncontrolled blood sugars (long history of the uncontrolled blood sugars, that’s not the facility’s fault). \n\nThe nurse in the hospital said my mom would only be that bad due to negligence. Is this always the case? I’m calling tomorrow and I don’t even know what to say or who to start with. I was thinking the social worker there. \n\nMy mom had a colonoscopy the week before. I spoke to the gastroenterologist and at no point did he mention anything about the bed sore. "

      "story": "I’m trying to really understand the differences in services and care provided between a skilled nursing facility and an assisted living facility. \n\nMy father (early 80s) has been living with Parkinson’s for a few years. He needs help with most daily activities. His mobility has become severely limited over the past year. Getting out of bed, showering, getting dressed and toiletting are some of his biggest needs with assistance. He’s started wearing diapers, which has reduced the need for him to get around to the bathroom. He also has speech issues often, trouble getting out what he wants to say, often in a very subdued voice. \n\nMy mother and I have been trying to keep him at home, but the toll it’s taking is beginning to be too much for us to handle. Other than the effects of Parkinson’s, his health is great. No heart issues. No kidney problems. No cancer or other diseases. Cognitively, he’s definitely slowed down, but doesn’t exhibit any dementia signs. He’s just a bit slower processing things and responding. \n\nWe’ve thought about home health, but it wouldn’t be possible for someone to be there 24/7 to assist. \n\nHe has recently been in a skilled nursing facility doing rehab after a fall. He was going through physical and speech therapy, but the therapists have determined he’s basically topped out on his progress the facility wants to discharge him, which means his medical coverage will end and if we decide to keep him there, then it will need to be through private pay. \n\nAs I’m sure you all know, SNFs are very very expensive. And maybe if someone is using or needing all of the services the cost is justifiable. The assisted living services in the area are nearly half the cost and seem to provide all of the aspects of care that he needs. \n\nWe’re considering whether to try and keep him in longterm care at this SNF or try to get him into the assisted living facility. \n\nIMO his real needs are diaper changing, help getting n and out of bed and wheelchair, help with showering, occasional feeding help and medication management (he knows when to take his meds and what he needs to take, he just can’t get the bottles open).\n\nAny advice or thoughts on the situation? \nWhat/who are SNFs truly meant to help with? The services provided seem more than what he needs. \n\nThanks for reading all of this and providing any insights. "

She lives alone, but very close to my house, and I go over to see her for a bit almost every day when I'm not away at school (about an hour drive away, I'm on summer break now, but I come home often on the weekends during classes). My great grandmother had never lived alone before my grampa died a few years ago, he had dementia and was almost 100 at the time of his death, and she was basically a full time caretaker for him for years. \n\nSince he died, she's been very depressed. She's on medication, but every time I see her she seems anxious and sad, all she does many days is sit alone in silence. She used to enjoy activities like cooking, sewing, and gardening, but she's unable or unwilling to do them anymore because she gets tired very easily when standing, and her manual dexterity has gone downhill. She's totally cognitively sharp, and can get around well without a walker or cane or anything, she's just very anxious and depressed all the time. When I first went away to school, she called me every day for the first week or so crying or on the verge of tears. I'm trying to figure out some sort of activity I can do with her to give her something to think about and enjoy during the day. I think part of why she's so unwell is because she doesn't have anything to entertain her. My grandfather (her child) has told me not to bother trying to find anything, because every time he's tried she hasn't been interested in picking back up things like playing the piano or cross-stitch, but I think things might be different if it's something I can sit with her and do too? If any of you have had similar experiences and know of things that helped your loved ones cheer up or let you bond with them, I'd be very grateful for advice!!"

He did not break anything, thankfully, but he's really not able to walk at all right now. His legs are very weak and unsteady. This is a condition that has been ongoing. Prior to the falls he got around somewhat unsteadily in the house with a walker. He is very stubborn and refused to use a wheelchair, despite having had several falls before. But now his mobility issues have reached a sort of tipping point. My stepmother wanted some time to figure out the best set-up for him at home and to find a home health aide, and we all felt he obviously wasn't ready to go home yet. He cannot walk at all right now, and it takes two or three people to get him up and into a wheelchair. There's no way she'd be able to care for him by herself, and none of my siblings and I are local. But because he did not have a break or obvious major injury, despite all his doctor's attempts while my father was in the hospital to say that he needed more help, they could not get Medicare to approve him for acute care needs, so they would not approve him for a rehab or convalescent center. So my stepmother opted to pay cash for him to stay at a convalescent center for at least a week so we could figure out the transition. The problem now is she is being told that he cannot see the facility's doctor at all because he is a cash patient. We cannot pay out of pocket for him to see the doctor, and of course they won't allow his personal physician to come in and examine him either. Is this normal? He is only dealing with nurses and physical therapists at this point. Does that vary from facility to facility or state to state? We would really like him to see a doctor while he's in the convalescent center, at least once. It seems frustrating that he is literally not allowed to be examined by the staff doctor. The facility is in Virginia, if that matters. "

      "story": "I've been avoiding storying this for a long time. This is going to be super long, but I really need to get this out there. I have a sister that is 19 years older than me, never married, our parents are deceased, and I have no other siblings. There are no other family members living. I'm 58. Almost three years ago, I was notified that she had called 911 and was almost dead by the time they got to her after a fall with a O2 sat of 83%. She was taken to a rehab center. I lived two hours away, and to come up with a solution for for her care. The only thing I could do was bring her home with my husband and I. I went to her apartment to find out what things we need to bring back, and walked into the most horrifying and gross conditions I have ever seen. I won't go into details, but I had to hire a company to clear out everything, then had to pay the leasing office to condemn and then redo the entire apartment. She was addicted to pain killers, smoked like a chimney, and didn't take her other medications. She was also addicted to online shopping and ordering junk food to live. She had past due bills up the wazoo, blew her 401K on a condo that she left in the same condition. So called friends from her last job had her lie on  car financing and she ended up with a $650/mo car payment not including the insurance. So after six weeks of living with us and having everyone catering to her every need, we found an apartment for her to live nearby.  Mind you her income was only $2200 from SS. I don't even know how it was approved, since I didn't cosign. Anyway, I paid the rent on that apartment for close to two years, including her phone and utilities. I will never see this money again. So she falls again in December, 2023, and gets sent to the hospital again. She comes home with me again. She falls again right after Christmas and breaks her hip. Back to the hospital and surgery on only Medicare Part A because she didn't want to get Part B since she couldn't afford it. Okay, so now she has thousands of dollars in medical bills. Mind you, she has absolutely no savings to her name or advance directive. The bills go unpaid. The hospital releases her to a rehabilitation/long term care facility. She wouldn't do any physical therapy, just wanted to lay around all day and have everyone wait on her. Physical therapy wasn't covered by Part A Medicaid so I applied for her Part B and was approved. Too expensive, so we're back to square one. So in order for her to be a resident, her SS isn't enough to pay for it. Now I'm footing the bill for her care for that, plus apartment rent, and utilities for an apartment she thinks she's going back to. I was at my wits end draining our own retirement savings, receiving phone calls at all hours of the day and night with her demands to do this and that. (Including at work), and about to lose my job. She would call 911 if someone didn't answer her call button. Seriously, we were never that close, and I'm seeing now that my parents coddled her and bailed her out of everything. She thinks she's entitled. I can't love someone like that. I have enough issues of my own. I'm hateful, resentful, and bitter. Then I feel guilty for feeling this way. My mental health has been suffering, and I won't call or go to where she is. My anxiety is out of control. I just want to live without all this chaos.\n\n\n"

      "story": "Hi folks. In need of advice.\n\nI moved back to my hometown to take care of my dad. I now live with him. \n\nBackstory Physically: He had a second stroke in August, aspirated pneumonia from a heart procedure that same month. In November he was drinking, fell and needed ten staples in his head  and overnight hospital stay. Septic shock in December followed by six weeks in skilled nursing. Since then, he’s lost almost all mobility, requiring a walker for movement. Also legally blind, afib, watchmen on heart, kidney decline. \n\nBackstory Emotionally: I moved back when my stepmother initiated a divorce in March. Took him to see a psychiatrist. Depression meds. He also confabulates stories, and when confronted on things that are not true, he doubles down. Some of them involve spending large amounts of money. Has days of not wanting to get out of bed and refuses PT saying it’s too far to drive to the VA. Insists on having a few drinks despite me protesting because it affects his mobility and results in falls. As of now, he’s “mentally competent.” I’ve reported all social/emotional concerns to medical team. \n\nSince returning in March, I’ve hired a caretaker to be with him six hours a day while I work as a teacher. I provide medication management, meals 3x a day weekends and dinner weekly, hygiene prompts, exercise prompts. \n\nThe falls are becoming more frequent. He had two to my knowledge in February (was with wife, these both involved alcohol), one in April, and most recently this week, two more. We just got out of the ER for the second time this week with an all clear CT scan. One of these recent falls also involved alcohol. \n\nHe refuses assisted living if I ever bring it up. He was deemed eligible for AL by the Office of the Aging who did an intake assessment. He says he will die before going to AL. Health POA cannot be triggered until he is deemed mentally incompetent, which I know isn’t going to happen. \n\nI’m overwhelmed. Even with a caretaker in place, I spend hours sifting thru stories to figure out if I should be concerned, constant falls that result in doctors visits, constantly promoting and cheerleading just to get him out of bed to eat something or shower.  It’s full on from the moment I get home from work until 8-9 at night. \n\nWe can’t afford any more care and he makes too much money to be eligible for programs. I have a memory test lined up with the doctor. I have an appt with VA social worker to discuss my concerns. What more can I do? I don’t think I can’t keep going like this but unsure how to proceed, but I promised him a long time ago I would be there to take care of him in old age. I guess I’m asking, how much is too much for at home care? Am I at the too much point? No? Any help appreciated. "

They have no family or friends in the Las Vegas area, with most of their family (including me) in the Chicago area. Briefly, my uncle is physically and mentally fragile and has already been diagnosed with as being in early phase of dementia. He has fallen at home home numerous times (each requiring a call to 911 to lift him and bring to the hospital) and is currently at a rehabilitation clinic there (they only have a certain # of days there before their insurance will stop paying). They are \"almost\" broke, however, they each have a little SS for income (app. $3000 a month combined) and own their house (although it is heavily mortgaged and they are just making interest payments on it). \n\nMy Aunt, while physically healthy, is under tremendous stress and completely over-whelmed trying to deal with her husband's complex medical needs and seems incapable of navigating the paper work to apply for needed aid (i.e., medicaid) and generally make important decisions she needs to make. She cannot take care of my Uncle at home as the last 3 times he was discharged from a hospital or a rehab facility, he attempted to walk on his own and fell. To make matters worse, neither my Aunt or Uncle know how to use a computer to research or to apply for anything and don't even use a cell phone. Thus, she can only receive calls on her landline and from her ancient answering machine when she returns home at night from visiting my Uncle at the rehabilitation facility daily. As a result, she often misses important calls from case managers from her insurance (Humana), social workers, etc. We are trying to do what we can to help her plan long-term for my Uncle's care but we aren't in a position to help them financially and can barely offer guidance on what is her best path forward given my Uncle's needs (as we are not familiar with Nevada elder care resources).\n\nWe're at the point where we need someone who is an expert on elderly medical care, what resources are available, and to literally meet in person with my Aunt to make a suitable plan going forward. We are willing to foot the bill for a consultant that can help her during this trying time, assuming the cost is reasonable. As a reminder, they cannot afford to pay for long-term care (either at home or in an assisted living/memory care facility). Can anyone recommend an elder care consultant/advocate/lawyer, etc. in the Las Vegas area who can guide and advise my Aunt? Thank you in advance! "

His parents didn't put a lot of stress into teaching him any discipline in this area & weakness to impulse purchases. A factor that is far more concerning now that I'm not a 5 yr old who knows he might cave on getting me the latest toy I want & an adult worried he'll spend himself quite literally out of house and home!\n\nIt was less of an issue when he was working, but he's on indefinite unpaid sick leave (he has his own health insurance) with the implication he's very close to being fired! So he has nothing coming in, and he's gotten more easily confused and forgetful. His long-term memory remembers how to suss out telephone & email scams, but he's weak to 'recommendations' from youtubers he watches.\n\nThank god for amicable divorce, because my dear mother volunteered to help him unravel the snarl that is his spending, his reoccurring charges, the 3 different Hallmark subscriptions he didn't know he had! But he keeps signing up for new things, getting delivery he doesn't need & just generally making very unwise online purchases.\n\nIt's a constant issue & it works out because she's more subtle, not his child & he has always respected the duck out of this woman. But this isn't a solution, not by a longshot. Nor is this level of persuasion something I can replicate if... if I lose her first...\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nSo as to the title? Are their any apps or programs out there that can put a temporary roadblock in this process? Something that can be like 'if you need this come back in 6/12/24 hrs when you've thought it over.'? Cause I think I can sell him on at least 6.\n\nOr something that can help limit the $ amount, or how many times he buys in a period of time. I think he'd be on board with these (when they aren't annoying him in the moment).\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nAs a side note: I'm brand new here & I've been really curious ever since the ADHD diagnosis a few years back. Does anyone know anything about how age impacts ADHD?\n\nI'm curious both to help him, and because myself and others I know and care about have this and other nurodivergences. Which leaves me wonder, cause time won't wait for us either. Unlike my father, I take medications that really help & are not copacetic with the heart problems that run on his side of the family... But trying to look up anything on the subject is turning up very little.\n\nI want to help him; I want to know what to look out for for myself & others in the future. But I don't know where to start?\n\nUpdate: He quit. He is formally unemployed. (I was unaware of this)"

      "story": "What is your experience with filing and managing a claim against an existing long term care insurance policy?\n\nI’m NOT asking whether you recommend getting a long term care policy. My parents already have policies and I’m trying to get a claim processed so we can start using the policy to pay for home health care aides. \n\nThe insurance company I’m dealing with uses the same portal as a number of other companies. It’s absolutely insane. A few examples:\n\n- I filled out the claim online, and when I submitted it, there was no way to get a copy of what I had filled out. If I had known that, I would have taken a screen shot of each page before clicking Next, but now that I’ve submitted it in the portal, the portal won’t show it to me. (Turns out I can send them a written, signed request for them to mail it to me - more on that in the next bullet.)\n\n- The “Documents” tab shows me that their nurse who performed the in-person BEA assessment to confirm that my parents need help submitted her report. But when I click to view it, the portal downloads a 1kb PDF file that is un-openable. When I called tech support to ask what’s wrong, they explained that the garbage PDF is actually a security feature - the information is so sensitive that they won’t let me download it. Instead, I can send them a written, signed letter asking them to mail me the document - because somehow, paper mail is more secure than a password-protected portal. \n\n- I set up the portal to turn on all the Notification options, but they don’t work for everything. The only way I can tell whether they have another document for me to fill out is to log into the portal daily and poke around. However, some requests don’t even show up there, so the support agent suggested that I call them daily to see what’s going on and whether I have to fill out a new form. \n\n- Every request takes 10 business days to complete. At the start of this process, I asked them to send me a copy of the policy - they said “10 business days.” Sure enough, an envelope eventually arrived, storymarked 10 business days from my request - and the paperwork inside is dated the day after my request. It felt like they printed out what I needed right away, then sat on it for 9 days before putting it in the mail. Everything takes 10 business days. Somehow, I suspect that if I told them I wanted to sign up for a new policy, they’d have someone on my doorstep that day, but to process any part of a claim takes 10 business days. \n\nWhen I started working with the aide agency and told them we had long term care insurance, he said that he works with those companies a lot and I should prepare myself for how they work - they basically delay everything in hopes that the claimant will give up and go away. I just can’t believe how horrible the customer experience is, especially for a policy my parents spend 40+ years paying into. \n\nSo, after all that venting, if you’ve ever filed a claim for a long term care policy, do you have any strategies for how to deal with the company effectively?\n\nThanks!"

I love her to bits, and she’s helped me massively from 16, when I moved in with her and my grandad at the time. She’s basically been like my Mum. \n\nWe lost Grandad three years into me living here. I was about 19; this was around eight years ago now. \n\nGrandmother can be extremely stubborn at times and definitely has bad anxiety. Her support system is myself, my Aunt (her daughter) as primary, and then she has two other children (my Mum) and her son (my Uncle) who occasionally come and lend a hand in caring for her now. She doesn’t need full-time care; in fact, most of the time, she’s pretty independent. My issue with living with her is she often worries about things that don’t need to be worried over. If I wave and ask where, say, she’s put my coat or if she’s seen XYZ, she’ll, instead of perhaps saying ‘I’m not sure’ or ‘I think here,’ she’ll follow me around looking for said item (I didn’t ask for that, I just asked if she’d seen it around). She also falls ill quite often and gets an upset stomach. I’m betting it is on her diet. I’m quite fit and active and eat a very good diet; Nan, however, despite doing all the cooking, does not eat the type of meals I eat despite them being tasty, single-ingredient-based, and I know for a fact she’d have fewer of her illnesses she has now if she changed that. She’s also a great liar and will lie her way out of things. \n\nI love her to bits, but this becomes unbearable sometimes. Especially when I feel my independence is threatened or as if my life is a scapegoat for her issues. I.e., she’ll be more concerned about if my dinner is cooked as opposed to what she’s going to put in her belly (which tends to be a microwave / oven meal). \n\nHas anyone else had to live with someone who’s stubborn, perhaps lies, and focusses her purpose on your life? As a side note, things have got easier as I’ve grown up at her house. She isn’t as bad or hovers around me, lurking and asking what I’m doing as much as she used to. I also may expect some replies of why I haven’t moved out. We have a strong bond, me and Grandmother. I’m also her fourtante, and she allows me to save. Hopefully, in a few more years, I’ll be able to leave home and move on in life. "

He never applied for Medicaid. He never filled out a will or POA.\n\nHe lives in a house 5 miles from town. He lives in squalor; ignores everything. Leaky pipes, rotting trash piled high, vermin everywhere. No way should he be driving. He doesn't know how to--or won't--pay his bills or Mom's memory care facility bill. He spent 45 minutes in the passenger side of the car, fumbling for his keys. If I hadn't randomly pulled up and noticed him, he might have baked alive in the July heat. I don't know of any social contacts he has. He doesn't answer his phone or, usually, the door.\n\nI photographed all this, and I have a call scheduled after the holiday weekend with the local APS. I'll also get in touch with my regular social worker from the local ADRC and the social worker from Dad's area, who's aware of his problems (but maybe not that they're this bad).\n\nI live about a half-hour away. My mental health is also jeopardized by this, owing to CPTSD from their mentally-ill household. I have a career and my own life to deal with. I honestly don't know what I could even do to excavate their finances at this point... and I don't know if pursuing guardianship, in this case, would functionally demolish me. I could try to find a geriatric care manager, but I couldn't give them any pointers on where to begin, either.\n\nIf anyone has run into a case like this, can you suggest anything beyond what I've already put in motion? I don't want my Mom to get thrown out of memory care, or Dad to decline without professional support, because neither of them took any responsibility for their futures. Still, that's not my responsibility--and I have no idea where I or anyone could even begin. It seems like a job for the professionals."

      "story": "\n\nLast December, my brother (47) was found dead in in my grandparent's home, in the room that he had occupied pretty much since childhood. Paramedics had to tear the door down in order to get to him. Despite being an accomplished athlete in his prime, he died severely overweight and in extremely poor health.\n\nMy grandmother (90), in turn, was found on the floor of the laundry room, having fallen some hours, or perhaps even some days before. The paramedics took her to the hospital where she stayed for about a month. Afterwards she was discharged to a nursing home, where she has been for the past five or six months.\n\nShe would like to go back to her house, but there is now no one there to stay with her. Over the past five years, she has lost most of her mobility. She cannot walk without a walker and can barely walk with one. She often has issues making it to the bathroom on time, cannot think clearly, and has dementia plus early signs of Alzheimer's. She often imagines things, has visions, etc.\n\n**Brief Backstory**\n\nGrew up in a small military town. Grandparents were local legends.\n\nMy brother and I spent a number of years living with our grandparents.\n\nAfter my grandfather (84) died in 2014, my grandmother (then 80) asked my brother to stay in the house with her. Before asking him, she asked if I was willing to do so, offering to buy me this or pay for that. I told her that I would be moving around for work and didn't feel comfortable committing.\n\nThis was before her health begin to decline.\n\n**Upbringing**\n\nBrother and I were 7 years apart. Parents divorced. Mom was and still is a nervous wreck. We spent a fair amount of our childhood with our grandparents. Last time we lived with our mom, I was in the 4th grade.\n\nWe were both **extremely** **overweight** as kids and as adults. My brother found sports in middle school and overcame it briefly but gained the weight back after college.\n\n**Brother**\n\nMy brother always had a hard time telling people no and just went along with things, much to my dismay. We always kind of had each other, no matter how chaotic everything else was.\n\nHe was teaching high school full-time, coaching, and taking on this role of counselor and caretaker for my grandmother. He was basically her safety blanket.\n\nHe took care of my grandmother's finances, did the shopping for her, and played mediator between my mother and her.\n\nAll of this, along with sort of thinking about how he had lost out on the prime of his life, wore him down. I could see it each time I would visit.\n\n**Myself**\n\nCurrently 41. Again, have been significantly overweight since childhood. Always had trouble socially because of it. Didn't graduate high school. Missed out on huge swaths of life.\n\nFound work in tech. I've always made decent money as an adult, but have never been in a real relationship, etc.\n\nMuch of my progress as an adult has come after periods of distancing myself from my family.\n\nIn 2019 I made a decision that if I didn't change and do everything possible, I would end up miserable and dead. After a series of false starts dating back to 2013. I basically moved away, traveled, lost over 170 pounds and made a bunch of changes that led to increased professional success.\n\nWith all of that, I always felt guilty because my brother was stuck in our hometown dealing with my mom and grandmother. I could never fully commit, I always felt like I should be relieving him of the burden. We would have discussions about it, but he would always say, \"I'm just staying here because I owe students loans\" and so on.\n\nI hated seeing him deteriorate the way he did and I have a lot of resentment because of it.\n\n**Question**\n\nI still need to lose another 100+ pounds to get healthy, find a real relationship, and just learn how to be an adult. **Am I a jerk** for prioritizing my health and life?\n\nMy grandmother has options. She can afford to live in a care facility. She has a son that is willing to have her move in (probably not the most reliable situation though) and a sister (94) that wants her to move in so that her nieces and grand-nieces can care for her.\n\n**But she wants to be in her house.**\n\nMy grandparents raised me and my grandmother always brought me everything I asked for. It's likely I don't have a career in tech without her. Not sure where we would have ended up without them.\n\nBut I really don't see how I fare any better than my brother did.\n\nApologies for the long story. Hope it makes sense."

      "story": "Sorry this is SUPER long, but I (20s F) need to get this out I feel like I’m stuck in the exact situation that I promised myself that I wouldn’t be in. Back story: My mom was raised by her paternal grandparents, so she was basically their daughter. Mom has an aunt and uncle who both lived far away, 1 out of state. So when Nan and Gramps (fake nicknames) were starting to get older, they put mom’s aunt and uncle in charge (Financial and Health POAs). Both of them put what Nan and Gramps wanted over what they needed because it was easier, which meant that any help Nan and Gramps needed, Mom had to help with. Both lived in their house until their respective passings, even though they could barely put plugs in outlets or make their own meals. Gramps had a part-time nurse towards the end, but my immediate family (mom, my adoptive dad, brother) did all the heavy lifting. When Nan passed twelve years ago, and Gramps passed two years ago, it was almost a relief because they were completely different people when they passed from the ones that we spent so much of our lives loving. Our relationship with Mom’s aunt and uncle is destroyed- they had all the power, and did nothing to help. \nFast forward to today: My biological paternal grandparents, Gran and Pop (again fake nicknames) are in their 80s. My bio father has long since passed, which leaves me and my two unmarried uncles. Both live farther away, both are the Health Care POAs. I and my other uncle have joint financial POA, but my grandparents have made it clear that he’s the predominant one. My grandparents are deteriorating- Pop has heart, back, chronic pain issues, and now has to walk with a cane almost full-time. Gran has bladder issues and arthritic knees, so she uses a cane on bad days. Both are having cognitive issues, and I’m almost positive Gran has some form of dementia. I’m trying to convince my grandparents to get geriatric evaluations and look into the at-home care resources I’ve found, but they refuse. My uncles don’t want to do anything that my grandparents don’t want to do. It’s exactly what happened with Nan and Gramps all over again.\nI don’t know what to do. I thought that if I learned more about the aging process and elder care resources, I could do more to help my grandparents than I could with my great-grandparents. But everything’s happening all over again, even though I promised myself that I’d make sure that I did things differently with Gran and Pop. I thought my uncles and I would be a team. I thought that after seeing everything my family went through with Nan and Gramps, Gran and Pops would behave differently. I was so wrong. I feel so naive and hopeless. When I try to be assertive about my grandparents getting help, I’m treated like I’m crazy and controlling. But if I let my grandparents do what they want, I feel negligent and irresponsible. \nThey just removed the railing from their front porch because it was rotten but now they and my uncles like how it looks without a railing, so they’re going to leave it as is. They don’t even plan on adding banisters for the steps. They have hanging plants on the overhang of the porch that they also want to keep there. I’m terrified they’re going to fall off the porch and feel frustrated that aesthetic is being prioritized over safety. \nAt this point, I don’t know what to do. Do I just say “screw it” and let my grandparents do what they want, even if it hurts them and breaks my heart? Do I risk ticking everyone off and demand that I or someone local, like a friend or neighbor, be appointed as POAs, or beg one of my uncles to move closer or move my grandparents closer to them? Do I just cut myself off from the situation? And no matter what I do, how do I stop my heart from breaking and guilt from eating at me? No matter what I do, I feel like I’ll hurt someone’s feelings, which I hate doing. \nI hate that everything’s happening all over again, especially so soon. "

My grandma is driving me insane, she wants to know where I am and what I'm doing every second of every day and she bosses me around like I'm a fucking toddler. It has gotten to the point where, whenever I have to take care of her, I can't shower or go to the bathroom and take my time because she just gets hysterical and starts screaming my name. Her neighbor takes care of her at her (my grandmother's) house so I can get a break but whenever she's there I get calls upon calls of her asking me what I'm doing, where I am and telling me off for staying home alone. I literally have no life, no friends, no chanve to go out and take a break and even if I did she'd just drive my mom insane about my whereabouts until I come back home. On top of this she's very confrontational and refuses to listen to me or her caretaker, which makes dealing with her even harder. I don't know what to do because everyone else in the family is too busy with work, taking care of their children or taking care of their own parents to help and her doctor already said that she doesn't think its a good idea to prescribe my grandma any more pills. I don't know what to do because I love my grandma and feeling like this makes me feel like a bad person but I don't think I can keep doing this. The only thing I can do right now is pray that the rest of summer goes by quick so I can go back to college and spend my days away from her and her hounding"

      "story": "My 95 yo mom has lived with me for the past five years and broke her hip a few weeks ago. She had hip replacement surgery and some severe delirium afterwards. It’s taken her about a month to get better mentally. She is mostly better but she still seems like she forgets that she is at rehab. I’m not sure if she’s still having some occasional hallucinations. They told me that they are discharging her on Thursday. When I got there today, I asked her to stand up to see if her physical abilities had improved, and she could only barely stand with my assistance. She lives with me and of course work full-time. Before the fall, she was able to at least get to her bedside toilet in her room without me.  I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know that I feel it’s safe to leave her. My daughter is 22 (past medical issues) and at home most of the time, but I really do not feel comfortable asking her to have to change her grandma’s diapers and be basically a full time caregiver. She doesn’t want to go to a nursing home. I know that in-home assistance is not something that Medicare covers and is expensive. It would be out of pocket which is not something she can probably afford with her income (social security + pension). I feel absolutely completely exhausted. I do all the cooking and cleaning 99% of the time and I’m taking care of her and working full-time at a job that takes almost an hour commute daily. I have spent the last month going to rehab to see her after work and door dashing my kids food every day. She has been nasty to me telling me that I am just trying to get rid of her and that I don’t want her around. I just don’t know how I can continue like this though. In order to get her into a nursing home if I decided to go that route, I would have to exhaust all of her funds from her bank account on medical expenses in order to apply for Medicaid. I feel like a bad daughter if I do that, but I just don’t know how I am going to keep going at this rate. I feel like I have no life. What would you do?"

I have basically moved back in with my parents to help them with things they need running errands, cooking, cleaning, mowing grass and such. They do not have Medicaid to allow them access to in home care. He is still considered to be in his right mind. However...he consistently refuses to bathe. His lymphedema causes constant skin weeping and open ulcers since he doesn't bathe he ends up septic and in the hospital. This has happened about 7 times in the last couple years.  He smells like gangrene or dead flesh and is still refusing a bath. I have tried to offer any help that he would need, bargaining times, to being the \"bad cop\" raising my voice and getting water on him to wash him where he sits. He just becomes angry and refuses everything no matter how respectful or how much time I give him (days at some points) He does not understand that him taking a bath is a life or death necessity to him due to his wounds. I genuinely do not know what to do. I have to wait for him to be out of his mind with a fever every time to get him to the hospital as well otherwise he won't go. I am desperate for some advice from maybe an attorney or just people that has dealt with this issue before. Thank You all in advance."

      "story": "Hello,\n\nAny help or advice I can get would be appreciated. My father is schizophrenic, and my grandmother is as well, they live in a small trailer on our family property, after their roof went up in flames due to not cleaning the chimney. My father who is my grandmother's caregiver, purchased this trailer in lieu of fixing the roof of our family home. \n\nMy father is not well and believes people are torturing him and my grandmother through electronic devices. He spends a ton of money trying to prove this theory but cannot and continues to neglect my grandmother. What is worse, is that they are both unwell and feed off one another’s delusions (this has been the case since I was a child).\n\nFast forward to two weeks ago, I received a Facebook message from my aunt (my dad’s sister) advising my grandmother has not been able to move for at least five days from her prone position (unable to use a restroom to defecate or urinate). I called APS and the police department (which I have done in the past), and the police department stated that they would not go out to do a welfare check, unless she agreed to go with the paramedics. It took heaven and hell for her to agree to have paramedics check her out, and they responded accordingly. Because my dad left the very small tailer that they were staying in locked, they would not break the door down due to my father’s violent tendencies.  They could speak to my grandmother through the door and while she agreed to being seen, they couldn’t enter the trailer.\n\nAPS eventually went out to evaluate my grandmother, but she refused help once again. The night before APS went out, I spoke with my grandmother and there was fear in her voice. When my dad approached her, she quickly hung up the phone, saying “your dad is approaching, I need to get off”. This incident was two weeks ago, more has transpired since then.\n\nI received notice that my grandmother was admitted yesterday to the hospital because my father finally called 911. She has moderate to severe injuries but still refuses to recognize her neglect. I am asking for anyone to provide any personal experiences or help as to how to move forward. I have been in constant contact with the hospital, hoping something can be done to help her, but because her “basic” needs are met, the social workers have their hands tied.\n\nI really don’t want to have her very hard life met with a difficult end."

      "title": "Isolation abuse?",
      "story": "I (35f) and my husband (37m) lived next to an elderly lady (lets call her Deb) for the past few years and became good friends with her, often having a whiskey in the evening or tea and cookies in the afternoon. We felt protective over her as her husband passed shortly before we moved next door and her two adult children made no attempt to maintain a relationship with her (she referred to them as \"rotten\"). She would even spend Christmas with us because she had no one else. Last autumn she suddenly disappeared and we had no idea if she was ok and had moved or if something happened to her. We didn't have contact for her kids so we were left helplessly wondering. A couple of months ago, her daughter moved into the house. I popped over to introduce myself and got very weird vibes...almost like \"why are you talking to me\" vibes. I asked what happened to her mom and she said she moved into a home. Upon me asking,  she told me which home. I was so happy that Deb was ok and began visiting her with our new baby that she had never met but had been so excited that we were expecting. Seeing us and the baby was clearly a highlight for Deb as she had been put in the home suddenly after falling and ending up in hospital - hence why she was gone without telling us anything. During one of my visits to her, she mentioned that her children never visit her, instead her daughter would sometimes drop off some personal items at the home for Deb and then leave without even saying hi. Other than us, Deb never had any visitors. Last week it was Debs birthday so we went with balloons and cake. We were pleasantly surprised that her daughter was also visiting her that day! We didn't stay long as to not intrude but had a little visit and Deb got to snuggle the baby while we chatted with her daughter about general neighbour stuff. The whole visit was quite awkward as her daughter maintained the \"why are you talking to me\" vibe and seemed very unimpressed that we were there to visit her mom. I shrugged it off because I wasn't there for her, I was there for Deb. \nFast forward to today. I had told Deb I would be coming by for a visit, and upon checking in I was denied access as visitors for Deb are now restricted to family only. I immediately burst into tears thinking about Deb and not being able to see her anymore. This seems cruel of her daughter to do and feels like some type of abuse...how can you isolate someone like that when you only visit on their birthday?! Deb shares with me how sad and lonely she is and how she just wants to go home. I am devastated that I cannot see her and even more devastated to think she might feel abandoned by me. I just don't know what to do. Advice??\n\nI am not sure what the daughters motives are. Jealousy? But if so, just visit your mom more. Pure evilness? That's what I'm leaning towards :(\nIs she worried we are trying to somehow take advantage of her mom? I can't see that being the case because if she truly cared then wouldn't she be more active in Debs life? I just don't know. Should I approach the daughter?\n\nTLDR: my neighbour's daughter moved her into a home and has cut off our visitation with her. Looking for advice on how I should proceed"

      "story": "First story here (throw away account because im afraid of the internet) but I and my siblings have been taking care of my grandma for the past few years. She is in her late 80s and me and my 2 siblings are in our mid to late 20s. Long story short we got thrust into this role after our father died of an addiction battle which was incredibly hard on us. He was an only child. That left us to care for her. At the time she lived several states away so we had to figure out how to sell and buy a house across state lines without any help which none of us had experience doing (side note she is a level of hoarder so that was fun). But we did it. We found her a brand new home in a senior community with in 15 min of us. She has very kind neighbors who help her and keep her company and take her out multiple times a week. We set her up with everything she needs and were very very supportive through this transition as I know it was just as hard on her as it was on us. She is pretty active for her age and can do a lot things on her own. The issue is she is mean, unhappy, and generally very difficult person to be around. I'm tired of how ungrateful my grandma is even though I think we have done more than the average person our age is ever expected to do. She is never happy no matter what we do. We constantly hear about how awful it is our dad died. Even though we were tremendously impacted by it the focus is always on her and making sure she is okay. She is a compulsive shopper and has a drinking problem she passes off as a funny personality trait. \n\nShe is an incredibly friendly and out going person to everyone, even complete strangers. So she comes across as this sweet old lady that people love. We don't get that side of her and it just makes it harder. I know she talks down about us to her neighbors and we have caught her doing it with people with in earshot of us. She makes us out as never visiting, never helping, and basically forcing her to move here. She was truthfully an amazing grandma when we were children and I owe many of my good memories to her. But once we grew up and became individuals she became a lot harder to be around (you can tell kids what to do, adults tend to have more opinions). \n\nThis whole situation turned my life upside down. I no longer can plan for my future with out her being a factor. I refuse to start a family because I truly don't think I have the capacity to do both. If a career opportunity or desire led me to want to move I couldn't. It feels like I'm giving up some of the best years of my life and no one seems to appreciate nor understand this. We are all in therapy and I have constant waves of anxiety, anger, and sadness because of this and it makes it so hard to just live a normal life. I know each year will only get worse from here as she ages.\n\nI try to remember this is hard on her too and try to be sympathetic. I also try to be optimistic and think positively knowing my situation could be worse. I am grateful for the help we do have and that she is financially secure.\n\nHad a hard day today so looking for a space to vent. Thanks for listening."

      "title": "What Customer Stories Taught Me About Family Dynamics and Mobility Challenges",
      "story": "I work in the mobility assistance industry, and over the past few years, I've had the privilege of speaking with hundreds of customers about their experiences with mobility challenges. One pattern keeps emerging that I think this community would find valuable: the universal struggle of when and how to tell family about mobility issues.\n\nI wanted to share some insights from these conversations, especially since so many people seem to go through similar emotional journeys, regardless of their specific condition.\n\n# The \"Secret Keeping\" Phase\n\nThis happens way more often than I expected. I'd say about 60-70% of our customers mention initially hiding their struggles, even from close family.\n\nOne customer, Howard, who has IBM, told me: \"I was diagnosed at the very beginning of 2018. It was a shock to me. I was very upset and depressed that I had IBM, and I didn't tell anybody about it, not even my family, just my wife.\"\n\nAnother customer with multiple sclerosis shared how his wife had to physically help him stand with a \"one, two, three\" routine, but they kept this private struggle within their immediate household for months.\n\n# Why People Wait to Tell Family\n\nFrom the stories I've heard, the reasons are usually:\n\nFear of becoming a \"burden\" - This comes up constantly. People worry family will feel obligated to help or change their lives.\n\nLoss of identity - Many describe feeling like they're no longer the \"strong one\" or \"independent one\" in the family.\n\nUncertainty about solutions - A lot of people wait because they don't know what options exist, so they feel like they're just sharing problems without solutions.\n\nProtecting family from worry - Especially common with parents not wanting to worry adult children.\n\n# The Turning Point Stories\n\nWhat's interesting is hearing about what finally motivates people to open up:\n\nSafety scares - Often it's a near-fall or actual fall that makes secrecy impossible.\n\nMissing out on family events - One customer told me about skipping his granddaughter's graduation because he was worried about the seating situation.\n\nSpouse exhaustion - Partners often become the \"bridge\" between the person with mobility challenges and the rest of the family.\n\nFinding solutions - Howard's story continues: \"Then, lo and behold, I heard about SitnStand. I looked at it. I couldn't believe it. I bought it. I still couldn't believe how well it worked. It just gives me the confidence to go anywhere I want at any time.\"\n\n# What I've Learned About \"The Conversation\"\n\nFrom successful family conversations I've heard about:\n\nTiming matters - Most people say it worked better when they had some kind of solution or plan to discuss, not just the problem.\n\nStart with one person - Usually a spouse or adult child who can help navigate telling others.\n\nFocus on maintaining independence - Frame it around \"here's how I'm staying active\" rather than \"here's what I can't do.\"\n\nBe specific about help needed - Instead of general \"I might need help,\" people respond better to \"I might need help with X situation.\"\n\n# The Surprising Positive Outcomes\n\nWhat really struck me from these stories is how often family involvement actually improved things:\n\n* Reduced isolation - No more making excuses for avoiding gatherings\n* Shared problem-solving - Families often research solutions together\n* Increased social activities - With the right tools, many customers report doing MORE with family than before\n* Deeper relationships - Several people mentioned feeling closer to family after being honest\n\nOne customer's spouse told us: \"It's really transformed my life, not just his. We've just been praying that God would show us a way... and all of a sudden, this solution came across the internet for him, and he found it.\"\n\n# For Those Still Waiting\n\nIf you're reading this and still haven't had \"the conversation\" with your family, here's what I'd suggest based on these customer experiences:\n\n1. Research your options first - Having even one potential solution makes the conversation feel more hopeful\n2. Start with your biggest supporter - Usually there's one family member who you know will be understanding\n3. Focus on activities you want to keep doing - Rather than limitations, talk about goals\n4. Be open to family input - Sometimes they've been worried too and are relieved to finally discuss it\n\n# Questions for This Community\n\nI'm curious about your experiences:\n\n* Did you go through a \"secret keeping\" phase? How long?\n* What finally motivated you to tell family?\n* How did your family react compared to what you expected?\n* Any advice for others still struggling with this decision?\n\nI know every situation is different, but I've been amazed by how many common themes emerge across different conditions and family dynamics. Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences.\n\nNote: I work for a company that makes mobility assistance devices, so I hear these stories in that context. I'm sharing because I think the emotional/family aspects are universal, regardless of specific solutions people choose."

I have a friend for whom I'm one of a small group of people caring for her and we're all worrying. \n\nLet me call her \"Bee\". She has family in a distant country and talks to them on the phone but hasn't seen them in person in many years. I think the family members she's closest to don't speak English so it'd be difficult for me to discuss with them if I wanted to. So people who're with her day to day are all friends.\n\nSo, Bee is extremely independent, extremely determined. She has very bad knees and a host of other health problems that have prevented her getting knee replacement. Also she has financial and insurance problems that make it hard for her to get a wheelchair or an accessible apartment. For the last few years she was continuing to walk around even though it caused her agony -- she wouldn't move out of her apartment to assisted living, refused the prospect of leaving her cats and losing her independence. She got to the point where she couldn't leave her chair very much. I and other people go there every day to get her food and do some cleaning. \n\nSo, a month ago her knees finally said No More and now she cannot even stand up... Not even to use the potty so she's just changing pads under her with great difficulty and you can imagine how well that doesn't work. It's awful, and she's getting so sick from immobility and poor sanitation. None of us friends is a nurse, we don't know how to lift her up and help. But she Will Not Hear of living elsewhere! She's just trying to get her insurance to provide her with a home nurse and so far they won't. She refuses to even stay in the hospital for a day, even if she's sick and in horrible pain. \n\nHow do you talk to someone like that??? We've all said, look, this is impossible, can't you just stay at a rehab center until better care arrangements are sorted out? And gotten a flat NO. "

Not for drama, but because I genuinely can’t stand to see good people mistreated, manipulated, or emotionally drained.\n\nI’m writing because I want to help limit Jono’s ability to cause harm — not just to others, but to himself as well.\n\nSome of what follows may overlap with things we’ve already discussed, but I thought it would be helpful to have everything gathered clearly in one place — all the cards on the table, so to speak.\n\nThere’s absolutely no pressure to reply or take action. This is simply here for your reflection and consideration — whenever you feel ready.\n\n**The Core Problem**\n\nWith someone like Jono, virtually any emotional response becomes **narcissistic supply**:\n\n* Praise? Supply.\n* Criticism? Supply.\n* Outrage or disgust? Still supply.\n* Calm advice? Supply again.\n* A regular chat? Yes — still supply.\n* Reacting to a letter — positively or negatively? More supply.\n\nHe thrives on eliciting emotional reactions — approval, disapproval, concern, anger. They all feed his sense of control and importance.\n\n**How He Harms You — and How to Protect Yourselves**\n\nYou might feel he “can’t really hurt you” anymore. But emotional manipulation **is** a form of harm — especially when it causes distress, confusion, robs you of peace and precious sleep.\n\nThink back to the letter he sent to his mum. Did it upset you? Most likely.  \nThink of the never-ending lies, scams, and manipulations — too many to list in one email. You’ve seen firsthand just how calculated and damaging his actions can be.\n\nIt may be painful to hear, but I believe Jono **relished** the distress those events caused. Not just for leverage — but for the emotional reaction itself. That’s **narcissistic supply**. For him, that’s a win.\n\nThat’s why I urge you to adopt the **Grey Rock Method**.\n\nIf long-term no contact isn’t feasible, this is the next best thing: no emotional responses, no deep conversations, no advice — just **polite, minimal interaction**. This is different from your previous “time-outs.” It means no email advice, no coaching, no gentle guidance.\n\nTry it for a defined period — say, **60 or 90 days**.\n\nYou don’t need a long explanation for Jono. Simply say you need some time to yourselves. He may demand a justification or try to debate it — but you don’t owe him anything. **Your preferences and needs are reason enough.**\n\nAt the end of that time, ask yourselves honestly:\n\n* Do I feel calmer?\n* Less drained?\n* Did the confusion and guilt start to fade?\n\n**You may find that Grey Rock isn’t just a boundary — it’s a relief.**\n\nImagine carrying a heavy bag of rocks on your back for decades — and finally giving yourself permission to put it down.  \nBe **one grey rock**, instead of carrying a **bag full of them**.\n\nI know Grey Rock or No Contact can seem extreme — but based on everything we’ve seen, I genuinely believe they’re the only approaches that protect your peace and stop the cycle. Even “firm boundaries” still risk feeding the manipulation. He’s **too skilled** at twisting softer limits.\n\n**Ask Yourself Honestly**\n\nAfter a typical interaction with Jono, do you feel:\n\n* Uplifted and calm? Or:\n* Drained, irritated, confused, guilty?\n\nIf it’s the latter — that’s harm. Subtle at first, but devastating over time.\n\nAnd if emotional manipulation stops working, I wouldn’t be surprised if he escalates to anger or contempt (“You’re horrible for treating me this way!”). That’s when people often see a narcissist’s true self — as I did.\n\n**The Nasty message Incident**\n\nI believe the Nasty message upset you so deeply because it exposed something real — not just contempt for me, but contempt for everyone, **including you both**.\n\nHe sent me similar kinds of affectionate messages to the ones that you receive. But that Nasty message shows what he really thinks behind all the manipulative affection.\n\nJono’s actions — his rejection of your values, his boundary violations, his lies — make it clear: he has **no genuine love or regard** for your emotional wellbeing. Your peace and happiness mean **absolutely nothing** to him.\n\nSomeone who truly loves and respects you wouldn’t behave like this for years or decades.\n\n**Narcissists Cannot Love or Respect Others**\n\nThis isn’t personal — it’s **pathological**. It’s a well-established psychological truth:\n\nA narcissist cannot love or respect anyone but themselves.\n\nTrying to help or fix them only drains the helper. And every bit of emotional energy you give becomes **fuel** — for more dysfunction and harm.\n\nIt’s like trying to put out a fire by **pouring petrol on it**.\n\n**What I’m Absolutely Certain Of**\n\nYou both deserve a **peaceful, emotionally fulfilling** retirement.\n\nYou’ve lived lives grounded in honesty and integrity. That should be **rewarded**, not disrupted by guilt or chaos from someone who preys on others.\n\nYou owe Jono nothing. You’ve already done **far more** than he deserves. He’s not a helpless child — he’s a fully capable adult.\n\nYou are not obligated to parent, guide, or emotionally support him anymore. That’s not cruelty — it’s **self-preservation**.\n\n**The Guilt Trap**\n\nI know you don’t want to “abandon” Jono — because you love him. That’s natural.\n\nBut I believe this guilt has been **deliberately planted** in your minds by Jono through phrases like:\n\n* “You’re all I have.”\n* “I’d be nothing without you.”\n* “You’re my only hope.”\n\nThese are **manipulations** — designed to weaponize your empathy.\n\nHe presents as a helpless child to trigger your nurturing instinct. If another persona worked better, he’d use that instead. It’s all a calculated presentation.\n\n**Rubbing Your Face in the Chaos**\n\nWhy does he tell you about his “scams and misdeeds” knowing it’ll upset you?\n\nWhy does he ask for your advice — then completely ignore it?\n\nBecause he enjoys the distress and drama it causes. He has no respect for your peace, time, or emotional safety. **Your needs simply don’t matter to him.**\n\nYou may have adapted to the chaos — it might feel familiar after decades. But familiarity doesn’t mean it’s healthy.\n\nYou can choose something better.\n\n**Peace is not a luxury. It’s your right.**\n\n**If Jono Were an Alcoholic...**\n\nIf Jono were an alcoholic, would you give him a drink because he begged or sent an “I love you” photo?\n\nNo — because you know that **one drink** leads back to chaos.\n\nNow think of emotional responses as **alcoholic drinks** — and Jono as addicted to narcissistic supply.\n\nWhy keep giving him that drink, knowing it leads to pain for everyone?\n\n**On Love and Enabling**\n\nYou can love someone and **still protect yourself**.  \nYou can love someone and **still say no**.  \nYou can love someone — and go no contact or grey rock — to prevent harm.\n\nThat’s not cruelty.  \nThat’s **strength and preservation.**  \nThat’s **love with boundaries**.\n\n**You Don’t Have to Do This Alone**\n\nIf this feels overwhelming, please consider speaking to a therapist or psychologist. Many have **extensive experience** dealing with narcissistic family dynamics.\n\nThere are online options — fully private and on your schedule — or local professionals in your area. If you’d like, I’d be happy to help you find one.\n\nYou could even share this message with them as a starting point.\n\n**Things Need to Change**\n\nSometimes people come into your life for a reason.\n\nMaybe Jono came into mine so I could meet you — to learn from your kindness, your values, and your generosity.\n\nAnd maybe I came into your life to help you **finally escape the cycle** of emotional abuse.\n\nI’ve only dealt with Jono’s abuse for a few years — and even that was more than enough. I can’t imagine what you’ve endured over the decades.\n\nWhat I know is this:\n\nI will **never again** give Jono the narcissistic supply I used to.  \nThat ends now. Forever.\n\nWhatever you decide, I’ll continue to wish you peace and happiness — always.\n\n**With warmth and hope,**\n\n**Your friend over the pond,**\n\n**Lew**"

I just had to send her screenshots of how to find the phone function and where the keypad is. I had to explain to her how to turn the volume up on her ringer. She’s like a child now. But we can’t live together. She’s reverse mortgaged her house, so she doesn’t own it anymore and we’re stuck in a 2 bedroom house with 2 kids, 2 dogs, and 2 cats. We literally have no room for her or her 3 dogs. But she doesn’t need to live alone, and we can’t afford to put her in a home, but even if we could she threatens to off herself if we even talk about it (which is silly bc we literally can’t afford it). But the fact that she doesn’t even understand her own phone now is just so….. there’s just so many feelings that I can’t even put it into words. I never anticipated that I would have to be my own mother’s caregiver. Or that she would devolve into the person she’s become, who is so absolutely opposite of the person she’s was when she was raising me. I don’t know this woman. I haven’t known her for a long, long time. And it’s just so strange to say that, and sad to say that. It’s like I already lost my mom, and now I take care of this angry, scared, confused shell that looks like my mom. Does that make sense? I don’t need anything from this story, I just wanted to put it out there, needed to get it off my chest. I’m sure this makes me sound like a terrible person, but I’m just having my feelings right now."

      "title": "Ensuring my father's \"final approach\" doesn't hurt us",
      "story": "Throwaway account since I want more pseudonymity. I am cross-storying from other subreddits to get additional exposure and support. \n\n  \nI was born and raised in California, and I am now almost 37 years old, the youngest of three sons. My father is 83, turning 84 this year. He is still relatively spry and independent, but age is slowly catching up to him. He does not need a caretaker, yet my brothers and I have been helping him navigate life on \"final approach\" (his words) since his wife and our mother passed away in 2021. It has not been easy.\n\nMy mother died in 2021 after complications of a lifetime of smoking. He was glad to see her through her end of life. Unfortunately, she was a severe hoarder. The house was at a \"level 5\" after her passing, when I helped my dad find a group to help him clear out the house. I was transitioning out of active duty military service on the East Coast and was working to return to school at the time. I linked him up with Steri-Clean to help with the hoard, which significantly improved the interior of the house.\n\nUnfortunately, we are at an impasse. Three years after this, and despite several major property renovations, my father still needs help. I ended up back living with him and sought to help as much as I could while navigating my current work life. We have old cars to get rid of, sheds to organize and clear, a yard full of rubbish and hazardous materials. The interior still requires a significant amount of clearing and organization, including the donation of and selling of items. He also has been derelict in estate planning. He says it's 75% complete, but this has been ongoing since 2022. He repeatedly told me to nag him to get it done, but has also been dismissive about the consequences of what would happen if he were to die without planning completed. \n\nThe major kicker for me has been his dedication and obsession with volunteering. He dedicates at least 15 hours a week to veterans' programs, including event planning and administration. He spends most of his time on the computer, where he has much trouble navigating. He also feels obligated when a local event is at risk of failure and tries to step in to save the day. He lets those priorities take precedence over his being active in walking, as well as spending time at his vacation cabin. I helped with some of those efforts for several years. I quit my involvement so I could straighten my priorities and for other reasons.  I want to see him continue doing what he enjoys, but the imbalance throws everything off.\n\nI would sincerely appreciate suggestions on how we can make the \"final approach\" as easy as possible for him, as well as for us. If he were to die tomorrow, everything would be in probate, and the property would be in an absolute shambles. I would like to recruit one of his close friends on the estate planning side as an accountability buddy, as she has been trying to do the same. I am also hoping to recruit more help with property work so that he can worry less about those things. But it is a continual struggle. Thank you for giving me time to express all of this."

I came prepared to be here for as long as he needed me, up to 90 days. In that two weeks, he fell three times. He has had several episodes of being very disoriented, one time not knowing how to open the garage door in a house he has lived in since 2008. Since his surgery, he has been very altered and has been hallucinating. They haven't been able to do much physical therapy because he's been so out of it. They stopped opioids to see if that was the problem, but he's still talking to people that aren't there.So instead of coming home, he's being transferred to a rehab facility later today. On top of that, in talking to the physical therapist about my dad's gait, he told me that my dad is showing signs of Parkinson's as well. So in a very short time, we're looking at the very real possibility that he is going to have to move into an assisted living facility. I have to talk to his doctor about tests and evaluations. Once we have that information, I'll have some decisions to make, including possibly moving him to the state I live in, which will make him very unhappy.  "

And as a 20-something software engineer (aka family tech support), I figured maybe I could help... and maybe help others in the same boat too.\n\nSo here’s my idea: What if I build a voice-first AI search tool? Basically, whenever he can’t read something, he just takes a picture of it. Then the AI reads it out loud, explains what it means, and he can even ask follow-up questions, just kind of like having a super patient grandkid who never gets tired.\n\nTo make it more personal (and possibly hilarious), I thought the AI could even use my voice. And if something looks off, like a weird charge or a sketchy letter, the AI could also ping me so I can step in and help.\n\nDoes this sound useful and interesting?

She’s been back home since January and lives on the same property as us in her own home which is convenient for times like this because she can’t really be left alone. I’m wondering if there are any more financial programs than the ones she’s already receiving for her at home care. She currently receives VA survivors benefits which is $1,500 a month and just started receiving 40 hours of assistance from a state funded (Massachusetts) Frail Elder Waiver. I just found out about PACE programs so I told my mom to look into the 2 that service our county. We are extremely grateful to receive this help, but I’m trying to find more for my mom. She pays $1,550 every week for my grandmas morning and night home care, which in order to do so she’s draining her retirement. She doesn’t want to take a home equity loan out on my grandmas house, but I think this might be the only other option. I know my mom feels like she’s drowning and sooner than later there’s going to be no retirement money left. I just really want to find another option for her before that happens. \n\nAt this point I personally think the home equity is the best option, since the payment would be a lot less than the $6,200 she’s paying now. Instead of the VA money doing little for that, it could pay for most of the monthly payment on the home equity loan. Any thought and suggestions appreciated! "

My aunt (dad’s sister) has her own health complications and cannot live alone either, and is taken care of by her husband. she lives 30 minutes from my grandmother. My dad has no excuse other than not wanting to deal with it, especially because he lives 2 hours away. His wife, my evil stepmother, treats my grandmother poorly anyway, and always makes her feel unwelcome. \n\n\nMe and my sibling (23) are the only ones who live close to our grandmother (5 min drive) and regularly check on her. the thing is, we are both college students. while during the summer i am able to sacrifice more time to see my grandmother, in the school year i never have time. my sibling is studying to teach and come next semester, will be doing student teaching and thus will be busy during the daytime hours when she most needs supervising. In other words, we haven’t even gotten to live and finish our degrees yet and are already being pushed into the position of being live-in nurses.\n\nMy dad’s solution is to “just put her in a facility” because he allegedly doesn’t have the funds to care for another person in the house (and there’s literally no physical room for her to stay in) but my argument is that if you have the money to just throw her away like that… you should just take care of her. \n\ni’m a little bit more lenient on my aunts reasoning, especially because her and my grandmother are a handful for my uncle who is mainly concerned with my aunt. still, she has the mental capacity to help with the decision making and should be more involved. both my grandmothers children deny just how bad she’s gotten— this is because they don’t see her nearly as often as we do— and thus are less inclined to care/understand the severity of the situation. the worst part of this though is that my grandmother is the most stubborn person. she refuses help, and gets in sour moods when someone does something for her. her biggest fear is losing her independence, and i really hate that for her.\n\ni don’t want her to have to suffer in her final years, i just want her to be happy safe and healthy, surrounded by people she loves. i don’t want her rotting away in a nursing home. i am horrified to think of my grandmother accidentally leaving the stove on, sleeping with the door open, falling, etc. but worst of all im terrified that any time i go to visit her i will find a corpse, which will leave me traumatized. \n\nwhat can i do? what can i say to my aunt and father to make them listen? can this situation even be helped? because there is very very little that i myself can do about it. i don’t have money to sacrifice for her because im a student. i love my mimi and just want her to have a peaceful life.

      "story": "My mom will be moving next week to an Assisted Living and her memory issues mean that she can't get past the grieving stage of leaving her home of 50+ years because the news is new to her almost every day.  On her best days she understands that this is the right thing to do, and on the toughest days she tries to bargain with me - like asking, can't someone just move in this house with me?  (She thinks my widowered brother could do it, but I have to explain to her that he works 2 jobs and he wouldn't be able to give her the support she needs even if he did move in there - and in her clearest days she knows that that is asking too much of any of us kids).  It's just been incredibly heartbreaking to see her go through this and not be able to process beyond the initial grief.\n\nI was wondering if those of you who have dealt with this situation could tell me how the transition went and give advice on how to make this as smooth as possible.

      "story": "Also about many doctor's in general though. Not all of them.. just seemingly 99% of them now days.. She has 1 really good doctor. My mom is 78 years old.\n\n\n\nMy question is about the physical medicine doctor. I talked to her primary care doctor, about me being concerned about her back pain. So he gave us a referral to Physical Medicine, and we were able to take x-ray's of the spine too.\n\n\n\nI was counting on trying to figure out what is safe for my mom to do, maybe some more tests about bone health concerns since she's always fracturing her feet, and also some treatment options to increase bone health, or muscle health. With her ankle x-ray 10 days ago, a radiologist noticed a small bone fragment came loose from ankle. \"Well-corticated bone fragment is seen adjacent to the medial malleolus\"\n\n\n\nInstead he was adamant on only discussing treatment options of \"acupuncture, or steroid pills\" to treat the back pain, and refused to discuss anything related to general bone health, or any other problems besides her back since her back was the only thing her primary care physician listed in the referral notes.\n\n\n\nMy mom can hardly walk at all, she's in bed all the time, and can only manage to use a commode right next to her bed. Many elderly that I know are able to walk much more than my mom..and are more active, so I was really hoping on this appointment to figure things out further. Like is it muscle weakness, of maybe look into hip problems, weight problems, position problems, etc?\n\n\n\n\n\nMy mom was complaining during the whole time about feeling uncomfortable, so he was more than happy to cut the appointment short to send us home so \"she can be more comfortable\".\n\n\n\n\n\nMy mom isn't a very cooperative patient due to her mental state, and I don't have a \"power of attorney\" over her, so many doctors shut conversations down and end appointments early even when my mom tells them to discuss things with me.\n\n\n\nThe only good doctor that I know of my mom has had forever is for pulmonary and he is happy to take time with my mom and discuss all of her problems even if it's not his exact specialty, and he's very good at making my mom feel comfortable with the appointment instead of looking to find any excuse to end the appointment early.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other issue I have with doctors I consider bad is they are quick to hand out treatments and drugs with hardly any discussion. Like I wanna know \"is this treatment safe for my mom?\" or \"Is this treatment necessary for my mom?\" Is there any side affects that I should be concerned about? Is there something we can do to make this treatment safer? How does my mom compare to other people her age?\n\n\n\nIt really feels like most doctors don't care anymore. My mom had a cataract surgery scheduled, and the day it happened, the anesthesiologist actually over ruled the doctor and said \"I don't think she's healthy enough to have the surgery\" and canceled it. The doctor looked a bit dumbfounded and said \"ok\".\n\n\n\nI still hardly have a clue what's going on, I wish I could get her doctors to care more. I want to find out the exact problems, and treatment options, and the complications that could happen if we do those treatments.\n\n\n\nWhat can I do? I'm hoping I can get her primary care physician to care more somehow..Switching seems very hard to do, and there seems little chance that if we do switch we'll end up with someone better. \n\n\n\nWe use Kaiser, southern california."

      "title": "Finding a Place For Mom",
      "story": "**My story, caring for mom with dementia**\n\n \n\n Most people don’t think about this situation until it happens and then they’re racing around in a panic looking for information on what to do. That’s exactly what happened to me. I should’ve known that eventually mom would get old and require around the clock care but for some reason I never prepared for it. Little did I know how hard it would be to get the right information. So, hopefully this article will help prepare others for when this unfortunate situation happens.\n\n When my mother was about 70, her husband (my stepdad) passed away. I noticed a change in her, like forgetting a lot and some anger issues, but nothing major. She ended up losing her home to foreclosure so I moved her in with me. By the way, I’m a single man, 49 years old and live by myself. She also has COPD, mild heart disease and high blood pressure. Everything went good for the first few years but she progressively started getting worse mentally. She was independent for the most part, so I was able to work and not worry about her. She got to where she refused to leave the house at all and also when her health started to decline, she absolutely refused to see any doctor. She started having severe anxiety and breathing problems and very high blood pressure. She had numerous trips to the hospital for blood pressure issues and breathing issues. A few times I found her on the floor unconscious.\n\n One time, she was rushed to the hospital and we didn’t think she would make it, she was in bad shape. She eventually started to recover at the hospital but was bed ridden. I talked to the doctors about dementia. I was told that a hospital cannot diagnose dementia. I was told that she would have to go to a psychiatrist. But being that she was bedridden at the time, that was impossible, nor would she ever agree to that. The hospital called one day saying she was ready to be discharged. I panicked! How would I care for someone, by myself, that is bedridden and needs 24 hour care? I had no idea who to call or what to do. They set her up with home hospice which called me and assured me everything would be ok and they will take care of it. They sent her home with a hospital bed and all the equipment we would need. Home hospice, for the first week, came by everyday for about 45 mins per day. After the first week, only 3 times a week. I soon found out insurance wont pay for any more than that and it was up to the family to provide 24 hour care. In my situation, “Family” was just me. I was working with a social worker about placement into long term care but was told it could take several months. Luckily I have a sister that lives abroad that flew here to help for a couple weeks until she had to go back to work. Mom started to recover quite quickly and was soon up walking and then was able to take care of herself. They discharged her from hospice care. She did good for about a year but was slowly declining mentally and still refused to see a doctor and follow up visits.\n\n Mom is now 76. One day, I come home for lunch from work and went to check on her and found her unconscious on the floor beside her bed, barely breathing. I called 911 and they transported her to a different hospital this time, which turned out to be a much better hospital than the last. The doctors said she was probably unconscious for at least 8 hours or more. So it must have happened sometime that night as I didn’t check on her early in the morning because she’s normally asleep when I leave for work. Turns out both shoulders are fractured, a fracture in her back and neck. Doctors say her bones are very brittle. She recovers while in the hospital for about 10 days. She cant walk but can stand with help, barely. They send her to a rehabilitation facility. Medicare will pay for 21 days, after that there is a copay of $210 a day. While in rehab, her dementia gets worse and worse. I start talking to a social worker to get the process going for long term care.\n\n Mom qualifies for Medicaid for nursing homes, which is different from regular Medicaid. You can have a lot higher income to qualify for Medicaid for nursing homes. She has no assets and only receives SSI. Which isn’t nearly enough to pay for long term care which, in my area, starts around $8000 a month. So we would have to find a place that accepts Medicaid, which a lot of places are self pay only. They submitted referrals to a few nursing homes and some rejected immediately. Then more referrals are sent out and more rejections. I soon realize that all the facilities request her medical notes and records and I’m pretty sure it’s because of her dementia episodes that she’s rejected, even though she’s never been Officially diagnosed with dementia. Eventually the social worker tells me that it normally takes 90 days to find someone to accept her. This is where I really start searching for help, knowing that soon they will send her home and I will no longer be able to work.\n\n I start scouring the internet for any help I could find. There are several websites that say they will help you find placement at no cost to you. I called a few, but once you say she will have to use Medicaid, they say they cant help. Those websites are just looking for referral fees for self pay patients. I called numerous government funded programs, center for aging etc, that assist elderly people in these situations. Every single one I called would say, “I recommend you call so and so”. I call so and so and they say the same exact thing. Not one organization gave me any useful information on what I could do to speed up the process. The 21 days pass and she’s ready for discharge from rehab, still cant walk and can barely stand with assistance. Most of the time there, she refused physical therapy. After all this time, I never found help or answers to my questions after about 100 phone calls.\n\n They once again send her home and I prepare to quit work to provide 24 hour care. This time they set her up with home health which comes out 2 days a week just to check her vitals. They do provide in home physical therapy also but mom refused any type of physical therapy. I had to assist her to the restroom and help with her diapers so she could use the toilet. After a few days home, she starts waking me in the middle of the night yelling for help. I would go in her room and ask what she needs and she would say she doesn’t know. She started staying up all night thinking it was daytime, it’s called sundowners dementia. After about a week or so she started standing and wandering around the house in the middle of the night and a few times she fell and would scream for help. Every night she woke me up yelling for something. I didn’t sleep for a couple of weeks, a few hours here and there. I started losing my mind and it was scary.\n\n This is where I finally found help! One day, I had her in her wheelchair in the living room watching tv. I walk outside for maybe 2 mins, I come back in and shes screaming for help. I find her on the floor in pain. I get her onto the couch and asked what happened and she didn’t know. I call home health and told them what happened and they said they will send a nurse out. A few mins later, her case manager from home health called me to see what happened. I explained the situation and told her all about what has been going on as far as wandering at night and the numerous falls. I told her I haven’t slept in a couple of weeks and I’m afraid mom will wander outside or god forbid I find her dead one morning. This sweet lady told me she understands what I’m going through and said “ I shouldn’t be telling you this but since she has had a fall, call 911 and send her to the hospital and once she’s there just refuse to let them send her home, because its an unsafe discharge”. She said that they will have to find a long term care facility to accept her and they will expedite the process. This blew my mind!! After all this time, Nobody has ever told me this. Now, you have to realize that, by her telling me this, her company is gonna lose this contract with mom. This lady is the one person that actually helped and understood what I was going through. Maybe she went through the same thing with a parent.\n\n So I call 911, they send her back to the same hospital and find out she refractured one shoulder. She stays there for about 11 days and she doesn’t qualify for another round at a rehab facility because insurance wont cover it. They contact me about discharge planning. I told them she could not come back home because its an unsafe discharge. I told them she has had numerous falls and wanders at night. They said they will start the process of finding placement for long term care. Within a few days, they found a place that accepted her. It sure is amazing how quick this happened when a hospital needs to get rid of a nonpaying patient, being that they couldn’t bill medicare anymore. Anyway, she is now settled into long term care and turns out that the place she’s in is a very good facility. They take very good care of her 24 hours a day. I pop in every other day and its been great.\n\n I hope this article helps others through this process. In these situations, it can be just as bad on the caretaker as it does on the parent being cared for. Lack of sleep, depression, not being able to leave the house, not being able to pay the bills, just to name a few. You’ll feel guilty as hell about placing mom somewhere and you’ll feel relief. It’s completely normal. But you have to do whats best and safest for your parent and you.\n\n  Sincerely,            \n\n Patrick Parker\n\n \n\nP.S. I highly recommend getting a Durable Power of Attorney and an Advanced Directive ahead of time. Before your parents are in dementia stages or when you start to notice problems. I was lucky to get them signed a couple years ago and it made everything so much easier when all of this happened. Please prepare ahead of time.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "

She’s very anti-doctor and anti-pharma, and didn’t want to go in to get it diagnosed.\n\nShe has fallen several times in the past year. The worst was this past April. I was on a road trip with my girlfriend, and tried calling and texting her several times with no reply. I had the foresight to give her neighbor a house key. I asked him to check on her, and she was collapsed on the floor. There was also a trail of fecal incontinence on the floor.\n\nEMTs estimated she’d been on the floor for at least 10 hours. She underwent a battery of tests in the hospital, and they determined she had an inflamed sigmoid colon. The inflamed section was removed, and they gave her a colostomy. At the time, they said it could be reversed, and she could regain normal bowel function. \n\nAt her last check up with the surgeon, he recommended against it, and said he thought she should have the colostomy for the rest of her life. A few days ago, it sprung a leak. She’s currently in skilled nursing. She called me in a bad mood, and said she wanted to do the reversal surgery.\n\nI’ve been reading up on the reversal surgery, and it would require an additional hospital stay and recovery. Risks are an infection, and sporadic bowel function during recovery and possibly months following.\n\nJust wondering if anyone has had an experience themselves or with a loved one that had the colostomy reversal surgery done, and what your experiences were?  \n "

First thing he did was \"kidnap\" them (mother's words) to an assisted living - literally told them they were visiting for a tour but in reality had already arranged for them to stay.\n\nHe had also made all arrangements with a realtor to sell off all of their possessions and then the house which netted ~$3M. The siblings were only alerted of all of this after the deals were done. It was a quick turn around that was clearly planned behind every one's backs.\n\nMy father in law passed a month later - he simply gave up after the shock of the move. My mother in law was confused and depressed - she wanted to stay in her home with aides (which she could afford).\n\nWell yesterday we got message from brother in law that he was \"blessed\" to buy a house for himself...at $300,000 in a condo community. This man is disabled and living on $30,000 annual SSI benefits. He hasn't had a job or other income in 20 years. He insists though that he is paying for the house with his own money. \n\nMy husband and his sister are livid, sister in law especially is heartbroken. She loved her dad and he insisted that brother in law look out for her financially. She has had traumatic experiences in the last several years and getting back on her feet. Brother in law sent her $10,000 after the house sold with a note that she wouldn't be getting anymore money. \n\nClearly he \"blessed\" himself with the new home. We are all concerned because brother in law also has struggled with a gambling addiction. If he is Skimming to buy a house he can't afford, we are all concerned about the possibility of money for mother's care suddenly being gone b/c he relapsed. \n\nMy husband isn't sure there is anything to be done. Is there recourse if the person in charge of $ for an elders care is misusing funds? I should add my mother in law also has dementia. \n\n "

      "story": "I'm not sure if this is mainly a US group, but if there is anyone out there that could advise it would be much appreciated. \n\nI took over care, in a small capacity, for my father (84) when my mother passed away two years ago. He has professional carers and I deal with groceries, finances, appointments etc. and the stress \n\nHe lives in an 'independent living' facility, so has an alert system if he falls, all the aids - rails, walkers etc - but he just god dam keeps falling. He's had multiple hospital admission and diagnosis that it's either his insulin dosage - type 2 - blood pressure, that's causing the falls, all resolved according to the hospital. \n\nOn his last discharge from hospital, after 8 weeks, he fell again within 4 hours of being home. I was with him until half an hour until he fell, and he was standing and walking ok, for him, while I was there. As soon as he was left alone, he lost balance and was on the floor. He says he just lost his balance on standing, no quick actions or anything he shouldn't be able to do. \n\nHe has a roller walker and a riser chair. And we've had all the council support assessments which come back saying he's mentally and physically able to support himself, and has all the equipment he should need. \n\nI'm just at my wits end as to how to keep him independent safely. His falls have become more frequent as time has gone on. Before his last hospital admission it was onece every two days and I'm really worried he'll hurt himself on the next fall. Any suggestions much appreciated "

He owns his house, although it is a serious hoarding situation.  He hired an independent POA about 6 months ago right before going into a care facility.  The POA still has yet to sell the house due to the hoarding mess.  \nJust recently, the POA suggested we establish an irrevocable trust.  Is this a good idea to do?  What possible reasons might be driving why he would bring this up now rather than 6 months ago and why would he suggest this rather than just selling the house and saving the money for my father’s care costs?   I know the details will matter here to know for sure, but am looking for what philosophy would drive this approach.  Thank you."

      "story": "My mother is 92 and mostly not able to get around without a wheelchair or a walker, and is becoming more paranoid and unreasonable.  My father is 91 with Alzheimers and advanced dementia, and he is pretty much completely deaf.  \nMy 92 year old mother has been the primary “caregiver” for my father and is in control of all of the decisions for the both of them.  I have power of attorney for my father, both durable and medical, however my mother refuses to give up control.  \n\nThey live in a facility with stepped care, and are currently in the independent cottages on the property of the facility.  My father needs to be in memory care, but my mother refuses to put him there.  She recently took a fall, and has been mostly bedridden for the last week.  They have a part-time caregiver who has been working 7 days a week since this happened, but she can only work a few hours a day because she has a 12 year old daughter who needs her.  Since my parents normally go to the dining room of the facility where they live, they have been unable to get their meals without someone bringing them to them, serving them, and cleaning up afterward.  My father needs to be led everywhere they go, and is unable to do anything for himself.  He cannot go to the dining room alone because he doesn’t know where it is (after five years of going there twice a day, every day) and he gets lost coming back.  \n\nMy father cannot be left alone for even a second, so anything that concerns my mother, including doctor’s appointments, etc, has to include my dad, since he still lives with her and cannot be left alone.  Taking them anywhere is a two person job, because my father gets agitated and someone needs to wrangle him whenever they are out.\n\nTheir caregiver, my sister, their neighbors and friends and I have all been taking turns bringing them meals and cleaning up.  And someone has to get my mother up and to the bathroom about every three hours, so we are all driving back and forth to take care of this. \n\nMy main issue is that my mother refuses to go into assisted living or to put my father in memory care.  She is frustrated with him so she is constantly yelling at him, as though he can understand her, and acting like this on purpose.\nShe had an opportunity to move into the main facility in a preferred unit, but refused it because it wasn’t on the floor she wanted.  Now there is nothing available, yet they cannot continue to live independently, (they aren’t now) and my mother has been told that my father needs 12 - 24 hour supervision, every day.  I have looked in to other facilities in the area that may have availability, but she refuses to go anywhere else.  She demands any unit they live have two bedrooms because they have had separate bedrooms for years.  To get someone in-home to watch him is ungodly expensive, and although my parents aren’t destitute, they don’t have millions, but most likely won’t qualify for assistance.  Although my father’s mind is gone, he is physically very strong and could go on like this for years. \n\nMy mother of course thinks people are stealing from her, and is constantly telling everyone how smart she is, which only shines a light on the fact her facilities are waning.  Her refusal to change their living situation is putting a huge strain on everyone around her.  My sister works full time, but has fortunately been in between jobs the last couple of weeks, only working part time training her replacement, but will be starting her new job on Monday, which is about a 25 mile drive.  She has a husband who wants her around when she isn’t working.  I only live in the area during the summer to help out, and actually live two states away, and have a husband who is 78 years old and very dependent on me.  \n\nHer increasingly unreasonable behavior is becoming alarming, and my sister and I are seriously considering guardianship.  Everything you present to her is met with an immediate “NO” which she yells before you even finish speaking.\n\n(Sorry this is so long and if you are still with me, I truly appreciate you.)  How have any of you out there dealt with a situation like this?"

He’s legally blind due to untreated glaucoma—he lost his sight mostly because no one was there to help administer his eye drops or take him to doctor’s appointments. He’s HIV positive, and diabetic. \n\nHis wife also has dementia and her adult son lives in the home. Up until two years ago, she was his primary caretaker. She’s come to a point where she does not remember much of anything. The son helps his mother with her meds, but has made it clear he will not assist my father. I flew out to Georgia recently and tried to hire in-home help, but the son refused to contribute to the cost of care—despite living in the home and watching my dad deteriorate.\n\nI’ve burned through my FMLA, and was let go. I can’t afford to relocate to Georgia without compromising my career and home life in L.A. I’m now looking into whether I can call Adult Protective Services or get the state to step in and assign a social worker, initiate Medicaid, or even take legal guardianship if my dad can’t advocate for himself. At this point, he’s refusing to leave Georgia. \n\nHas anyone else done something similar—essentially “surrendering” a vulnerable parent to state care from out of state? What was your experience like? Did APS actually follow up? Did your loved one end up in a good facility? Did you feel guilty afterward, or relieved?\n\nI feel torn and exhausted, but I’m also trying to be realistic. I’m doing everything I can from across the country, but I’m hitting a wall.

Although she has always been on the quieter side and introverted, she has had less and less interest in socializing, taking walks (her only form of exercise) and now, doesn’t cook much anymore even though she used to love cooking. She almost never calls me to check in or chat, so I do all the checking in. When we talk, she almost never asks me about my life or my interests, it’s only me asking her questions or prompting her to make conversation. She has been more forgetful, and has been getting confused more, but nothing like dementia-related confusion that I read about. I’ve asked her if she feels depressed and she says no, and I take her in for regular check ups and all necessary health care. I’ve thought about the possibility of some hearing loss, so I will take her to an audiologist. Also, English is not her primary language so I think this adds to the confusion because I only speak English. I’ve started taking back to the church she used to go to before the pandemic, which is in her language, so she has been happy to go.\nI know she would probably do much better/be happier if we lived together but neither of us want to live in each others’ houses. I have a great husband who is very supportive, and we are about to become empty nesters. It really seems like she needs someone to live with though, so I’m really torn because I can’t take care of 2 houses properly, and she is not really taking care of hers.  I hate thinking that she’s all alone, watching tv by herself 90% of the day. I try to go on walks with her when I can but I have a job and house/family to take care of and other things I like to do.\nOn top of all of this, she doesn’t have a will, but she does have TOD on all of her accounts.  I’m thinking: \n1. Get her to do a will and power of attorney, etc since I can see her mental clarity starting to slip. How do I do this? Do I hire an estate planner/attorney? It isn’t a very complicated estate.\n2. Who can I talk to for advice on what else to do? (Besides Reddit, lol!) I feel like I need advice for her and therapy for myself for all the worrying I do! I have 1 sibling who lives far away and he would not be helpful.\n3. Of course if money was not an issue, things would be a lot easier but although we are comfortable and she has enough to live on, it’s not like we have a lot of excess funds to do things like hire cleaning/cooking help and yard help. Or maybe that’s what we need??\n\nThanks in advance for anyone who actually read this far! I would appreciate any advice."

      "title": "Georgia APS and Guardianship System is a Confidential Trap — and They Almost Got Me",
      "story": "I just went through hell dealing with Georgia’s Adult Protective Services (APS), and I need people to understand how rigged and abusive the system actually is. It’s not built to protect—it’s built to control, profit, and cover up. If you're taking care of an aging parent and think you’re safe because you’re doing the right thing—you’re not.\n\nHere’s what happened to me:\n\nI moved my mother’s money out of Wells Fargo into a smaller local bank (Southern First) to simplify her finances and achieve a higher interest rate for her money. Next thing I know, someone from Wells Fargo files a confidential SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) and a local detective (Sandy Springs PD) gets involved. He writes two vague police reports months apart—April and August—accusing me of stealing from my own mom. He never talks to me or my mom - just talks to my sister to have her \\*back Wells Fargo elderly fraud claim against me\\*.  No charges, no notice, no investigation I was informed of—just shadow records.\n\nThen the detective tells my sister to hire an elder law attorney, who starts moving behind the scenes to build a guardianship case. They refer the whole thing to DHS/APS, which is 100% confidential under Georgia law. Bascially DHS /APS can coach my sister to  push a guardian action confidentially behind the scenes, all with taxpayer money cash.  They know she won't actually get it because we fight like hell and she's schizophrenic.  It's just an action to get their own guardian ein there.  Even my mom isn’t allowed to see any records about what was said about her, or who made the claim. And I sure as hell can’t get access.\n\nThen the cherry on top: they coach a doctor to claim my mom “needs a shot or she’ll go blind.” My mom calls me to cancel the appointment, and when I help her do that—they claim I’m obstructing medical care. Suddenly I realize the game: they’re trying to frame me as an abuser, cut me out, and force her into court-appointed guardianship or a nursing home.  Because APS is a colluding bunch of fraudsters who have their dirty actors everywhere, hoping to split up the pie known as your elderly mother's assets.  Once I caught on, I went into overdrive: rescheduled the appointment, hired independent caregivers, got new doctors, got completely transparent with the finances and even shared everything with my sister’s attorney. I had my mom get a competency test with a psychiatrist and write a letter telling APS to fuck off.  But it was amazing how much power they had.  They could operate completely in secret and were completely shielded by open records requests, and framing a situation where my mom woul foot the bill for guardian ad litems, attorneys, evaluations, her own attorney fees—all of it. All because the APS system lets them build a case behind your back with zero transparency and zero accountability.\n\n# Why this is total bullshit:\n\n* APS records in Georgia are sealed from everyone—including the person being “protected.”\n* No way to challenge or even know what’s being said until it’s already in court.\n* Law enforcement, doctors, and attorneys work as a coordinated clique, and you’re the villain the moment they choose that narrative.\n* You can be criminalized for *literally helping your own parent* if it contradicts the “concerned” narrative they’re building.\n* And all of this profits the system: attorneys get paid, doctors get referrals, GALs (guardian ad litems) get gigs, and your parent pays for all of it.\n\nThis is state-sanctioned exploitation dressed up as elder protection. If I hadn’t figured out the game and moved fast, they might’ve taken my mom and tried to toss me in jail—all over a canceled eye appointment she asked me to stop.  Anyone who experiences this needs to know that they can tell their elderly parent to write a letter to APS to fuck all the way off -- if they can just find a doctor to vouch for their competency.  I wish I knew this so as to prevent massive stress when they were planning to file this emergency action right at the wrong time in my life -- when I was prepping for my daughter's wedding!\n\n# "

      "title": "Money going missing from great grandmother",
      "story": "My 95 year old great grandmother has always lived at home. She is set in her ways about staying at home and living fully autonomously. In her older days, her POA’s (my aunt and grandma) have looked after her finances. The odd time my great grandmother will give me $20 for doing odd chores, gas, cooking, etc. and same to my father (who’s on the road most of the time for work), which is normal - so we both also monitor balances. \n\nEssentially we know we can trust all immediate family who are around. Within the past year or two she has had home care staff come in for extra help. While I was away at university, it had occurred where my grandma had noticed money missing, (I can’t recall exactly but $50-$100). With this occasion, there had been no action taken and just suspicion, not sure when the money could’ve been stolen. This led to the POA’s hiding the money in a cabinet. This would hold the majority of her cash on hand, about $300 leaving about $50 in her purse with small bills. \n\nFast forward to today, she had asked me to check her purse to count and give me $20. When I checked, her purse was empty. I later went down to my grandmas to chat for a bit. After leaving, she texted me asking If I had taken any money from great grandma today. I let her know I hadn’t and what I noticed. She had then told me there was $100 total in her purse that went missing. $50 for getting grass cut, and $50 for Culligan water, groceries, items etc. This has left both my grandma and I to believe the home care staff are to blame. She has a care provider come in breakfast, lunch, and bed time. \n\nAt this point we are unsure of how to catch this person or take legal action against them. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or advice based on how to best approach the issue. Thanks."

      "title": "FINANCIAL TIPS FOR YOUR ELDERLY LOVED ONES",
      "story": "Hi all.\n\nI worked as a financial counselor most of my life, have a masters degree in financial planning & counseling and was an Accredited Financial Counselor Planner Educator (AFCPE) and worked as a contractor for the Dept of Defense teaching personal finance. My favorite meeting was with an adult child of a senior citizen. I wanted to share some of the info I shared:\n\nI put together some tips for your elderly loved ones. I hope some of these help. It's long. I wrote this assuming it's for a parent so you may see parent when this applies to anyone you are caring for and have the responsibility for financial matters. This is not investment advice or legal advice.\n\n1. A record book\n\n Staying organized is key. I suggest getting an old fashioned sturdy notebook of all things financial.\n\nTheir social security number, birthdate, all insurance numbers and contacts, any medical information, doctors, meds, life insurances, banks, credit cards. All of it. \n\nA page for ID, address, birthdates, social security, apple ID etc, passwords. a page of doctors and numbers, medicines and amounts and where purchased, medical history, allergies, vaccines, shingles? Flu? Tetanus?, \n\nAnother page for credit cards, numbers, online sign ins, bank account, online passwords, life insurance, , amounts, beneficiaries, numbers,\n\nASK YOUR PARENTS IF THEY BY CHANCE HAVE ANY VERY OLD LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WERE SOLD IN THE 1940S. THEY ARE TYPICALLY FOR $1000, A FUNERAL POLICY. Be careful about that last insurance policy. The one I found had changed company hands three times and the first contact told me the policy was not paid up and was invalid. Not true. I had to email, snail mail, call, and make copies of everything, including make an online account in my mother's name in order to see that yes, in fact, the account was paid up and valid. ADVOCATE!\n\nAnother page for the VA. Service dates, enlist and honorable discharge. VA number, Life policies. A lot of veterans have a $5K life insurance pollcy from serving.\n\nAny credit cards, store cards, etc. All numbers, sign on and passwords and any secret questions\n\nWhen you sign up for accounts for them to freeze credit, you may need to log questions and answers. Best friend from childhood, nick names, things you'll need to recall later. Make note of all of these identifying questions!\n\n Then make photo copies and keep it in a google keep app on your phone. You will be referencing this frequently. Google keep is an easy app for your phone. It's like a digital bulletin board. I took photos of each page of this book and accessed it frequently if I was not at home.\n\n2. Legal Papers in place\n\nSomeone might want to speak to an attorney to inquire about a general durable power of attorney, whomever will represent them in medical and legal matters.\n\nI am not giving you legal advice. i am suggesting you speak to a legal representative who can explain what this is and if you need it.  The IRS and financial instituations use a similar type of form, but one that is their own, and they may require an in person visit and signatures.  Make sure all doctors and hospitals you visit have all permission noted for family members who might need to speak to a medical professional on behalf.\n\nThe Social Security Administration wants each person to have an online acct with a representative chosen. You can set this up in the presence and with the help of your parent but they have to be there and able to be involved in the choosing of the representative payee. That person can speak on their behalf should they become unable to manage their own finances. I had trouble signing my father up for this and even with a represtative on the phone, it would not go through. She stated up to 20% were not able to set up an online acct so be aware.\n\nHow might you convince your parent to do this in the event they are private and not wanting you in their business? My parents allowed me to 'start' helping with bills so I always called right in the middle of my father's favorite afternoon show. \"Daddy, I need you to give permission to Miss so and so, in order for her to speak to me on your behalf.\"  it wasn't long before he was asking me \"Honey, isn't there something we can do where I don't have to take all those calls in the middle of my show?\"\n\nYes, there sure is!\n\n3. Credit bureau freezes\n\nYour parents need to have their 3 credit bureau reports FROZEN so that no one can open a credit line in their names, and trust me, people are trying to do that as we speak.\n\nTransunion, Equifax, Experian. It's free. FREE. Always free.\n\nKeep the PIN or password in a safe place if her credit needs to ever be thawed. Google how to freeze credit bureau accounts. Do not sign up for monitoring service, each bureau must do a freeze or thaw for free.\n\n 4. Credit card online presence\n\nIf they don't have an online presence for their accounts: credit card, xfinity, bank etc. do that now. Explain to them their financial accounts ARE already are on the computer, and that they just can't see it. This is common with seniors who aren't computer savvy and might distrust online accounts.  Set up online accts for all financial accounts, bank, credit cards, investments, the VA, everything. \n\nSit with them and write down the sign-on information. Whomever is the financial manager needs to keep a look at the xfinity or other phone numbers in the history to watch for scam calls so the numbers can be blocked if they have a land line. On the cell, check history of calls, check for out of state calls, especially area code 876. That is from Jamaica, a common hub for scams. \n\nSpeak with the loved ones about common scams, the Grandson in jail, you've won a mercedes, etc. Ask your loved one to call you right away. My own father fell for the grandson in jail call, even though he had been well versed and educated on the scam. He called me and I convinced him it was fake, but he insisted on speaking to his grandson to make sure.\n\n5. Scams\n\nAlso, on any credit cards, you want to check for 'continuity charges'. The word may be different for different cards.These are repeated charges that might be magazine renewals at $79 or college classes or any other types of false charges that were inadvertently signed up for without them knowing. I found $275 per MONTH on my parents visa card that shouldn't have been there: porn, college classes, magazines and self care courses. All of these were scams charged most likely through a phone call that started with \"Can you hear me??\" and my father said, \"YES!\". The recorded word 'yes' was all they needed.\n\nSomeone needs to also check on those charity donations. Every. Single. Time. my parents called in a $35 donation, they were magically signed up for monthly repeated donations. One call can undo this. \n\nI set up alerts every time their credit card was used. Instant alerts for anything over $1. I also set up through their banking, a morning email showing balances. Be very aware of balances and credit card charges. Download monthly invoices.\n\nGo and meet with the bank manager and ask them to alert you to any attempted large amounts withdrawn. Ask them to block these and alert the power of attorney. Do not allow them to put you or a sibling's name on the account. Your parents should have a POD, payable on death, on all financial accounts.\n\n 6. Bank account\n\nAdding a child's name to the account will override the POA and upon the last death, all monies belong to that one child, not the intended POD beneficiaries. We requested my name removed by the bank manager, she falsely claimed she did this, and upon their deaths, my sister and I were told a large sum belonged to me, and me alone. It took an out-of-state auditor to spend eight hours reviewing the history of their account and POD to reverse this and it was done under great duress by the manager who asked me to never tell anyone. \n\n One step at a time. First thing, get that notebook. Edited to add: talk to them NOW while they have their wits about them and find out everything you can.\n\n Do they have a safety deposit box? Get a key, and go through it with them. Add your name to the box. Or just empty it out and close it. \n\nAlso, set alerts for her bank accounts. I get an email every single morning showing my parents account balance. I also get an immediate text if their credit card is used and is not present. (over the TV/telephone) This is how I cancel sooo many items they order then they never remember what they ordered. They ordered that brain series of books THREE times!) It's all about placing safety nets in place in the form of credit freezes, email and text alerts, etc. \n\nYou can put a LOCK in place on financial accounts through various means. Make a relationship with the bank manager!\n\n7. Last thing, if there is a credit card in a parent's name, when that parent passes, do not call the credit card company until you know the last bill has arrived and has been paid. Once you call and report the death, here in my state, the account online (that you should have set up) will be instantly shut down and the account will be turned over to a debt collector.\n\nYou may have medical bills that were paid recently that show back up and unless you printed off the monthly bills, you won't have that proof, due to the online access that is now removed. So cover yourself, don't use the card for anything, as that is illegal, and wait till you know you don't need access to the history.\n\nUpon death, purchase a multi folder file folder. Sections such as, medical, VA, insurance, funeral, etc will have all the important papers you will be referencing. And make sure when you do get that death certificate, you scan the front and back and keep a file as most places only want an electronic copy.\n\nYou will be filing two taxes most likely depending on time of death. My parents died early in the year, so we had to file that April for the previous year, then the following year for those six weeks they lived. Keep everything as the IRS did come back and I needed my references to prove the mistake was on their end, not mine. \n\nI know this is a lot, and it's just the beginning, unfortunately. Rules and laws change and different states will be different, but hopefully this is a good start.\n\nI hope this helps someone. Have a blessed day in your caregiving.\n\n\\-- "

A normal day had nine calls from Daddy, \"I can't find your mother' or \"We have a serious problem' And off I'd go, driving an hour to their place.\n\nMy entire life was consumed with them. Every day and every night. Medicines, managing pills, calls at 7pm that no pills were in the automatic dispenser I had filled that day. \n\nAnd yet...my 'friend' just told me I had not been a caregiver because they didn't live with me.\n\nShow love and care to your friends and family who are 'the one' who is the giver of care. It's beyond exhausting. It's soul deflating. I used to call my friend and say \"I need you to tell me this isn't going to go on forever'.\n\nShow them some love. They need it desperately.

      "story": "Pennsylvania is alone in allowing nursing homes, which are often corporately owned, to sue the children and spouses of patients over outstanding bills. Nursing home care costs a few hundred dollars each day, which means this can lead to significant hardships, even for children who are estranged, were abused by that parent as a child or played no role in their parent's decision to enter that facility in the first place.\n\nThis has effected me personally and I have also seen it in the work I do in elder care. But, unfortunately, I think many people are unaware of how our system works until it effects them. Nursing homes do work with families to help patients apply for Medicaid to cover the cost of care when someone enters their facility, but this can be a stressful and confusing process and families can struggle with locating all of the financial documents from the past few years that are required for the application, especially if there is no Power of Attorney in place.\n\nWhile the families are scrambling to locate documents and file the paperwork, then also during the period of time when the Medicaid application is being processed, bills are piling up. If it turns out the application is later rejected and the patient will be denied Medicaid coverage for any reason, family members can get hit with a large bill. Courts can even garnish wages to cover the cost of ongoing future care.\n\nAs we face potential cuts to the Medicaid program, I am even more concerned about how this could effect PA families in the future.\n\nCurrently, House Bill 65, which aims to reform our filial responsibility laws and make them more similar to those in other states, is with the house health committee while they hear from stakeholders. I don't know who these stakeholders are, but think we need to make sure they hear from voices beyond those in the nursing home industry lobby who want to keep these laws in place.\n\nPlease consider speaking out about House Bill 65, which you can read about here:\n\n[https://www.palegis.us/legislation/bills/2025/hb65](https://www.palegis.us/legislation/bills/2025/hb65)\n\nEmail correspondence can be sent to the Chairman of the Health Committee, Rep Dan Frankel at [repfrankel@pahouse.net](mailto:repfrankel@pahouse.net).\n\nGovernor Shapiro can be texted at 717-788-8990"

You’re allowed to take a walk, call a friend, eat something nourishing, or simply breathe for five quiet minutes. \n\nCaregiving doesn’t mean abandoning your own needs… it means finding ways to sustain yourself while being there for someone else.\n\nYou deserve support, whether it’s from a sibling, a friend, a professional, or an online community like this one. You are not alone. 💛\n\nWhat are the little (or big) things you do to care for yourself while caring for someone else?”\n"

The MobileHelp reviews were okay, but not great—people mentioned some issues with equipment and delayed service response.\n\nThat made me widen my search, and I stumbled on Bay Alarm Medical. Their setup seemed more transparent, and the reviews gave me a better gut feeling. I liked that people actually had good experiences in real emergencies—especially with fall detection.\n\nI got their system for my grandfather and he’s already used the help button once after a minor fall. They responded in under 30 seconds. That level of reliability is exactly what I was hoping for, and I’m so glad I didn’t settle."

It’s been anything but.\n\nI work full-time from home, and in between Zoom calls, I’m cooking her meals, managing her meds, cleaning up accidents (yeah… the incontinence stuff is real), and dealing with her stubborn streak a mile long. She refuses help from anyone but me—even when I bring in a professional caregiver just for a few hours, she acts like I’m trying to dump her in a home or something. It’s exhausting, man.\n\nShe won’t consider assisted living, won’t move in with any other family (not that they’ve offered anyway), and somehow it’s become “my responsibility” because I’m the single one. I’ve had to put my social life and dating on pause. My savings are taking a hit. My mental health is not great. Some days I just wanna drive off into the sunset and not look back—but then the guilt hits me like a truck.\n\nI’ve looked into getting paid for caregiving, but she has “too much money” for government help and not enough to afford private services. Awesome. I’m stuck in that perfect little in-between where you’re too broke to pay for help and too “well off” to get help.\n\nSo I guess I’m just here wondering if anyone else is going through the same thing. How do you manage caring for elderly parents without completely losing yourself in the process? Anyone figure out how to set boundaries without being made to feel like the worst human alive?

      "story": "Okay, I feel like that sounds crazy and borderline abusive, but we have reached a stage with my nana where something has got to give. She is a genuine danger to herself. She CANNOT be trusted to take care of herself and cannot live alone. She’s completely given up. I’m trying to get her to agree to assisted living, it’s what everyone agrees is best (nurses and doctors at the rehab facility, the social worker at the hospital and at the rehab facility, the physical therapists at both the hospital and rehab facility, etc.), but she wants to go back to her apartment and remain independent. She refuses to allow anyone to be POA because she “read One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest too young” 🙄. \n\nFor a little bit of context on why it is she cannot live by herself, she had a stroke at some point in the last couple of years. We don’t know when because she refused to go to the doctor until maybe 6 months ago? After not going for 20 years? She only went after she had a series of falls that we had to call 911 to get her up off the floor for. She can still walk, retained cognitive function, etc., but she favors her left leg a little bit. It’s something that would have been solved with physical therapy, if she did her exercises and followed PT’s instructions. She is, by her own admission, continent during the day. It’s only when she’s sleeping that she’s incontinent. Well. She’s decided that she doesn’t like getting up to go to the bathroom anymore (again, she is perfectly capable of walking and doing so, she just *won’t*) so she wears depends 24/7 (she doesn’t even bother wearing pants anymore) and does not change them between uses, NOR does she shower! Like at all! She refuses to! So that, in combination with the fact that she refuses to manage her diabetes, has led to constant UTI’s, which has led to her most recent diagnosis: encephalitis that’s causing rapid cognitive decline. I guess in some ways she is managing her diabetes. By not eating. Like less than 500 calories a day. She’s lost close to 80 pounds in the last 6 months. We set up a caregiver for her, but they can’t provide care if she doesn’t answer her fucking door and none of us have time to micromanage her and do everything for her, which is what she wants. This most recent hospitalization happened because she somehow managed to unplug her phone charger and her power lift chair and she was just stuck in it with no access to food, water, or the bathroom for 4 days. When caregivers couldn’t get in and we couldn’t get ahold of her, we went over there and found her. The nurse at the rehab facility said “I don’t know how something like this happens” and we were a little defensive initially, but explained, and she said “no, no, I mean, I don’t know how you get to the point where you don’t even *try* to get up”. She had canes and her walker right there, but she *didn’t even try to use them to get up*. She is denying she has depression and refuses to take any antidepressant medications, so idk. \n\nI’m her granddaughter and my mother and aunt are still alive, but I’ve been the only one taking care of her for the last 2 years, and the decline has been *fast* and *steep*. My mom is back in the picture after 16 years of no contact (it’s complicated and my nana is a difficult woman who put her through hell, so I’m not mad about it) and my aunt is back in the picture in a limited way after 3 years of exceedingly limited contact, but they both feel I should be POA. I work for a home care agency (I do the office side of things) and work closely with DHHS and coordinating care, etc., so they feel I’m more qualified. We even offered to split things so my aunt would take care of managing finances, I would take care of managing medical, and my mom would be like the 3rd signature/ tie breaker, and still no dice. I’m not really sure how to begin to proceed here, but I’m pretty sure I’m going to have to take her to court, which is going to destroy our relationship. I’ll do what I have to do to make sure she’s safe and cared for, though, I don’t care if I have to be the bad guy. I’m just incredibly tired and incredibly overwhelmed. I just turned 30, I just got married a month ago, I’m back in school working on a STEM degree, I have step kids, I have work, I’m in therapy and trying to prioritize my mental health, etc. I feel like this is such a huge time of change and transition for me and doing all of this stuff with her is just adding a lot of stress. If anyone has any advice on how I should proceed, I would greatly, greatly appreciate it! \n\n*ETA: she is currently in a rehab facility and they are refusing to allow her to return home because she’s not safe. The 4 days in a chair thing happened a couple days before Mother’s Day so this stay is apart of that whole mess. She’s taken both my aunt and I off her list so the social worker at the rehab facility can’t talk to us about what’s going on anymore. Everything we’re hearing we’re hearing through my mom. Also, my nana is only 71, lol. "

This is going to sound harsh, but this is a very harsh reality.\n\nI can't tell you how many older folks, and even my own Millennial cohorts, are \"spending everything they have and living for today, because who knows what tomorrow brings!\" Well, I'll tell you what tomorrow brings, and it's not pretty.\n\nIf you don't plan for a place to live when you are no longer able to live independently, you are planning to have a very shitty time as you \"live out\" your golden years in a \"facility\" chosen for you by a hospital or relative that is basically a storage unit for the sick, infirm, and elderly until you eventually die, which you will almost certainly welcome at that point.\n\nAlternately, your adult child(ren) will be forced to take you into a house (IF YOU ARE LUCKY!) in which they probably have no room for you, and no time to care for you, as every adult in this country has to work to afford the roof over their heads. You will make a stressful situation unbearable. You might destroy a marriage or two in your wake as your needs consume all of the resources that no one has. The days of a stay-at-home partner handling the kids, bills, meals, and mom-care DO NOT EXIST ANYMORE. You will rip someone from their livelihood or force them to spend their own meager funds on someone to watch you so you don't burn their house down while they're at work.\n\nIf you don't have a kid willing or able to take you in, there are hardly any beds available in \"good\" nursing homes, which typically only present as \"good\" on tour day, so you can be ASSURED the shitty ones are like living in hell, provided you envision hell as sitting in your own feces while underpaid, overworked aides ignore you at best. Someone else, probably your oldest daughter, will be forced to deal with ALL of your medical issues, whether you want them to or not, and on a schedule over which you have zero control. Do your kids live out of town? Do they have time to take off or funds to fly your way for every medical situation that arises?  If your caretaking kid has a work trip or gets sick, you are on your own. You will be stripped of your autonomy and dignity and your loved ones will have to watch with guilt and sadness as almost no one has the funds necessary to furnish you with a better living situation. These cost upwards of twice the average salary in this country. And if you're betting on the nursing home situation to improve, I have a bridge to sell you: It's only going to get *worse* as the boomers suck up every available bed and resource.\n\nIf you have been financially reckless, and end up in this very situation with no money or home equity to rely on to pay for your care, you will get the care that you pay for, which is (you guessed it!) shitty. It will take months to a year for Medicaid to review and approve you for services. IF Medicaid is even an option for you; if it's gutted to the extent Trump and his cronies are trying to do, you might actually just end up in the streets. It's anyone's guess what could happen here, and we're so precariously close to the point of no return NOW, that you might as well just assume that if you're poor, you're completely fucked and your final months/years will be one hellacious experience after another.\n\nThere's always the chance that filial responsibility laws that already exist in states like Pennsylvania will become the norm, so your financial fuckery will become the problem of any of your kids that are in remotely stable financial situations.

I grew up comfortable and at my age he already had a kid. He comes from a small, country village and has old person messy habits which I started noticing over the past year and are very annoying (ex wiping his hands on the curtain, hoarding plastic bags, spitting in the living room) and thus we can’t have nice things. This has become extremely inconvenient for me lately because then MY area too is messy. I can’t have friends or colleagues over because it’s always a bit dirty because of him. I cannot keep cleaning up after him. I work from home so I see it all the time and cannot go to office everyday either since he has mild balance issues. Please suggest any workaround for this, I want to have nice things in my house, but he is so messy. We don’t have a caregiver or full time help as it is difficult to find. "

      "title": "potential retaliation after reporting neglect at assisted living facility - need advice",
      "story": "I’m 24 and currently dealing with an issue at my grandmother’s assisted living facility. She moved in about 8 months ago, and since then I’ve personally witnessed their paging system fail at least four times. I’ve made small complaints before, such as her having to wait over 20 minutes after paging for help, but nothing has been taken seriously.\n\nThis time, I scheduled a meeting with the care coordinator (for privacy, I’ll refer to her as “Woman”). I’d previously been communicating with her about my concerns. The meeting was pushed back 45 minutes, and by the time it started, I’ll admit I wasn’t in the best headspace. I was upset that my concerns hadn’t been addressed and that my time wasn’t being respected. I’m also only 5’2 and was visibly shaking from anxiety during most of the meeting.\n\nAt the start, I told Woman that I understood this is a corporate business and they have policies to follow, but I was coming to her as a concerned grandchild. I told her that the paging system had been down the day before. My grandmother waited over 30 minutes for help using the bathroom, and later that morning, she waited 15 minutes for assistance getting downstairs for a doctor’s appointment. Because no one answered her page, she was late, which threw off my entire day and left me very dysregulated.\n\nWoman told me she wasn’t there that day and would follow up with me after checking the charts. I also asked her for clarification on what I needed to do when bringing in my grandmother’s medications, and she said they just needed a fax and that they’d handle the rest. At this point, it was clear to me that she wasn’t taking anything I said seriously — especially when she made a cold comment about how it wouldn’t be that hard to follow my grandmother’s end-of-life directive.\n\nI asked how she planned to address the issues I brought up, and she said they have a bid for a new paging system, but she didn’t know when it would be installed. Again, she said she’d need to check the charts and follow up.\n\nTwo hours after our meeting, I received a text from Woman that included information from my grandmother’s chart — but only from 7:00 to 8:15 a.m., and not in chronological order. (During our meeting, she had actually told me she shouldn’t even be discussing this with me because I’m not my grandmother’s POA.) The incidents I brought up happened at 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., which were not covered in her follow-up.\n\nIn the text, she claimed the paging system was only down for one minute at 9:30 a.m. However, I was physically at the facility at 9:15 a.m. and encountered three staff members who all told me the pagers were down — that’s how I knew there was an issue.\n\nI had an interaction with a nurse in my grandmother’s room, where my grandma told her, “I’ve been paging for 15 minutes and now we’re going to be late.” The nurse replied, “Oh, our pagers are out. Sorry.” I don’t remember exactly what I said, but it was along the lines of, “This is ridiculous — is there anyone besides Woman that I can talk to about this?” The nurse walked out as I was saying it.\n\nI then saw her at the elevator and asked again, “Sorry, I missed your answer.” She told me Woman was the only person I could talk to about this. I remember saying something else like, “I understand you’re just doing your job — I’m just really frustrated.”\n\nOn the way out, I kept getting stopped on every floor trying to get my grandmother to the car. That’s when I had encounters with Caregiver 1 and Caregiver 2. Caregiver 1 got on the elevator on the third floor and asked how I was, in a bubbly tone. I replied, “We’re late for our appointment because she was paging for 15 minutes with no answer.” Caregiver 1 started to apologize and I snapped a bit, saying, “I don’t want to hear excuses, I get it.”\n\nWe stopped on the second floor for her to get off, and Caregiver 2 was holding the elevator door while finishing a conversation. I said, “Guys, we’re late for an appointment — either get on or take the next one.” Caregiver 2 got on and asked if I was okay. I started crying out of frustration and said, “I know it’s not your fault, I’m just very frustrated right now.”\n\nNow, according to what Woman told me, HR is getting involved because of those “encounters” with staff, and they want to have a meeting with me — either by phone or in person — with no further context.\n\nI can’t help but feel like this is retaliation for making a report. I admit I didn’t have the best tone in those moments — I’m passionate about protecting the people I love — but it just doesn’t feel like it needs to escalate to this level.\n\nIt feels like they’re trying to scare me away from speaking up or advocating for the residents. And this isn’t just about my grandmother. It’s not safe for any resident in that facility to have to wait 20+ minutes after paging. Someone could be on the floor or choking, and no one would know in time.\n\nI’m just looking for other people’s opinions on this situation and advice on how I should handle it moving forward.\n"

I’m her main support, though my sister technically has POA. We’re in California.\n\nHere’s the problem:\n\n* She’s receiving extra meds from family members (we found empty Klonopin bottles from my aunt, and texts show she asked my uncle for more).  \n* Since January, she’s been in a downward spiral: recurring hospitalizations, falls, disorientation, UTIs, INR issues, vomiting, hallucinations—on repeat.  \n* Every time she stabilizes, she’s sent back to assisted living, then crashes again.  \n* She’s in the hospital right now, and I’m trying to figure out if there’s a way to break this cycle.  \n* Meanwhile, I’m paying out of pocket for her care. This month alone we’re facing $1,500 in extra charges due to added supervision. I’m terrified that this will turn into $8–10K/month if her needs increase, and my wife and I simply cannot afford that.  \n\nMy goals are:\n\n* Harm reduction and stability in an appropriate setting (assisted living, memory care, or SNF).  \n* Stop the diversion of medications from family.  \n* Protect our family’s finances while still providing safe care for my mom.  \n* Create some emotional breathing room so I’m not scheduling every doctor appointment, driving to hospitals weekly, and slowly burning out.  \n\nHave any of you:\n\n* Had to deal with elder addiction in assisted living?  \n* Found a way to enforce boundaries with enabling family members?  \n* Successfully transitioned someone from AL to SNF or a better-suited facility when they didn’t meet the obvious criteria yet?  \n* Navigated cost escalation without losing your mind or life savings?  \n\nI’m especially looking for any templates, strategies, or even scripts you’ve used with facilities, POA dynamics, or discharge planners. I’ve already started talking to the hospital about whether she can go to rehab (SNF) instead of back to assisted living, but I don’t know how to make that stick.\n\nThanks for reading.

      "story": "We just spent ~4k (US) on hearing aids for my grandmother after using the CostCo hearing aids for years. My goodness she is beaming! We recently made the move to assisted living after a stroke, she's 93 and I don't think any of us realized (especially her) just how bad her hearing had gotten. \n\nNot only is it great for her but man I can tell it's going to make all of our communications so much easier. I handle all of her business and sometimes I just dread it so much as I have to talk so loud about sensitive things and it makes me uncomfortable.\n\nI honestly don't think she would have ever done this if she didn't finally agree to try out assisted living. She was forced to reckon with her limitations and allow other people to help her and the quality of life boost is just such a joy for her but also for me. \n\nSorry for the ramble. Just a good day after 3 months of really hard days of cleaning up after in the bathroom, physical therapy, advocating at the doctor, advocating at the assisted living facility, yadda yadda yadda. Feels so good to have a win."

      "story": "Hey there, everyone. I'm reaching out for general advice regarding my mom's situation. \n\nShe has needed care for the past 3-4 years story back-surgery. She can't walk,  get up, bathe, toilet, etc. without assistance.\n\nShe had spent a few months in a rehab facility, but was sent to assisted living once her time was up there. She was bitter and angry about her loss of independence, and she lashed out at care staff, verbally and physically. She was eventually evicted from that facility & wanted to return home.\n\nOnce home, it was impossible to obtain full-time care for her, and neighbors did their best to fill the gaps, but it was not sustainable. \n\nI managed to get her into an assisted living facility near my work, and she has been there for 2 and a half years now. It's incredibly expensive, and we sold her home to help pay for it (her final asset). \n\nRecently she has been acting up again. Trying to hit care staff. Yelling at them, insulting them, and cussing. They thought it could've been a UTI, and they treated her for it, but the behavior remains. They've adjusted her meds in consult with her primary, but it's still an issue. Their regional team is very close to evicting her.\n\nMy question is, what do I do next?\n\nShe has no diagnosis of dementia or alzheimers, so memory care might not be appropriate. \n\nShe would do even worse in a board & care (she likes her privacy and quiet).\n\nFinding another assisted living to accept her after 2 evictions for abusive behavior will be very difficult, I imagine.\n\nShe can't come live with me (already 4 people in 940 sq ft condo, plus it's 2nd floor w/no elevator). \n\nI have POA, but I almost wish I didn't. When I confront her about her behavior, she lies to me about it.\n\nState of California if that helps.\n\nAny advice appreciated. "

      "story": "I've often gone to this sub to remind myself of how things could be worse, and I should be grateful for what I have. Just writing this into the void because I am struggling. My mom still lives independently but probably won't be able to for much longer. She has a chronic illness and is a widow, and I live a few hundred miles away. I feel some amount of guilt for this, but it is likely she can move up here to be with me when it is necessary. I try to support her how I can remotely, because she does need help. She has some sort of mild cognitive decline and visual processing empairment that doctors haven't been able to figure out- it leaves her struggling to read many kinds of text (books, bills in the mail, login options in apps, etc). It's probably just at the extreme upper end of the range of what could be considered normal aging, but it is likely partially related to her disease. \n\nI was just trying to help her login to Google stuff on her new phone and it was so difficult to walk her through the options over the phone with her visual and minor cognitive empairment. There are about 15 steps it feels like (avoid passkey prompts, enter her login, enter second factor, go to her email, get the code, etc), and she kept pressing the wrong things leading us to have to start over. I started to get frustrated and she knows me better than anyone, so she could hear it in my voice and that made her less able to follow my directions. I think I feel frustration with this tech support stuff, because I start to remember how smart and capable she was when I was younger, and how I looked up to her as the most \"street smart\" person in my life, who fixed a lot of my problems even in early adulthood. That person is partially gone, and I feel a kind of grief about it. \n\nI have gotten therapy in the past a couple times about this, but still struggle with this feeling of frustration and wishing my mom was the way I remember. I am kind of the first of my peers dealing with this issue (my parents were older when they had me), so I don't have in person friends to talk to about this who really understand. A lot of online stuff is about people in a lot worse situation than me. I try to remember that she is still here and I should be grateful for that. Outwardly, those complex feelings register as frustration, but I want to find a way to manage those feelings because I want to enjoy these last few years with my mom. I was wondering how you all deal with this stage of helping elders with stuff like tech support and staying patient. I could use any advice you have. It's weird because I am a longtime tutor and am often extremely patient, but when my student is my mom, it is a more complicated situation!"

I thought I would share what I have learned here to be helpful:\n\nA Place for Mom= A Place for Spam. Once you share your contact information with them they essentially sell it to communities who will call you every other day or more. [Caring.com](http://caring.com/) and others are similar.\n\nCreate a new email called [Xfamilynameseniorlivingsearch@gmail.com](mailto:Xfamilynameseniorlivingsearch@gmail.com) just for this to avoid sales and marketing emails. Never share your mailing address. There is a thing called cold lead campaigns, and you can receive sales and marketing materials and even calls for years after sharing your information. Usually, when filling out a form for pricing, you can put 5558675309 and the computer will send you the downloadable pricing email and pass that disconnected number on as if it's a real number.\n\nYou can call a community directly after dialing \\*67 to hide your number.\n\nYou can directly ask are you on-site or in a call center and just ask to be connected to someone on site. Have a script like, \" I understand each situation is unique and your job is to gather information but I once I have accurate pricing and availability I am willing to discuss further and consider a tour, thanks for your time.\"\n\nThey will always give you the starting pricing and try to get you to tour. Ask about the room size, levels of care structure and exact pricing for each one and write it down on each call so you can quickly narrow down where to tour and where is a waste of your time. Often times starting pricing includes nothing but a tiny studio and no care.\n\nThey really put their best foot forward on tours, making sure the foyer is clean, food being served that day is wonderful, etc. Try to schedule tours at the last minute, and try to talk to a caregiver or current resident if you can. Ask detailed questions like, \"Is the food prepared on-site?\" \"Where is it sourced from?"

      "story": "I storyed a few weeks ago about moving mom to AL. I wanted to share a few details for others who choose this route. I had no idea about lots of things. Sorry this is long!\n\nPaperwork - I filled out an entire inch of papers for admittance. This is a pay as you go place, and one page was them wanting to know all of mom’s assets. They don’t need to know what mom has, so I listed her social security payment, and the info for a long term care insurance she has. \n\nInsurance - another large pack of papers to fill out. The facility has to supply their license number and some other info. Mom isn’t covered by the insurance until the 21st day. We also don’t know yet how much they will pay. The policy says “up to” $150/day. We shall see. \n\nBeing misled - we did two tours of the facility, including the small apartment mom would have. He stressed that it’s “all inclusive” (outside of personal things like incontinence supplies or OTC meds). We saw a very nice shower chair in her bathroom that he said was included. There was a riser on the toilet too, which he said was included. As I started taking her belongings over, I noticed both were gone. And was told those aren’t supplied. So we quickly bought them, thanks Amazon. They also told us basic cable is included. There was even a page from the cable company showing the basic tier channels, in the welcome packet. When I asked him how we get mom hooked up, he told me they don’t supply cable, just WiFi. No problem this time, as mom prefers streaming Hulu, Prime, etc. The big omission was the $3000 “community fee”.  That was never mentioned over several visits, and the day I made a deposit to hold her room, he wanted me to pay it.  I squawked because that’s a lot of money to not have mentioned it before!  He told me they are “having a special promotion right now” and he would waive that fee. \n\nMeds - they said they have to take over all of mom’s medical care - doctors and meds, which are dispensed by the facility. Mom organizes her own meds, and has a doctor she likes. So I pushed back and they agreed she can do her own pills until she can’t do it herself. Mom also needed a physical and a TB test to be admitted. \n\nMeals - the manager told me the meals are all included. I told him several times that mom can’t walk to the dining room and she would need her dinner delivered to her. She will have her own breakfast and probably lunch. He said that’s not an issue, several residents need food taken to them. Once she moved in, we found out delivered meals are $10/ each. I challenged it at the office, and they agreed that if they didn’t tell us ahead of time, they won’t charge. But only for a couple of weeks until mom gets settled and the aids can convince her to let them assist her to the dining room. \n\nThe room itself - they had lots of safety rules like no toaster or fake fireplace, to avoid burning the place down. No rugs or extension cords to avoid tripping. She has a small fridge and sink with cabinets. But she’s 4’10” and can’t reach any of them. The rod in her closet is also about 6 feet above the floor and she can’t get to her clothes. Still, it’s a pretty nice room and all she does is watch TV, so she doesn’t need much. \n\nFinal advice - I’m just a farm wife and not too smart about business things. My husband told me that the facility salesman would negotiate. Some of what they tell you is just to makes the sale (like a car salesman). Be sure to read every bylaw and remember certain things are negotiable. Don’t be pushed into anything. "

I then contacted the Social Security Administration (SSA), who reviewed the situation and formally requested that Capital One immediately return the funds.\n\nEven after that, the situation was not resolved—so I filed a complaint with the CFPB. Only after that complaint did Capital One return the money.\n\nHowever, a few days later, Adult Protective Services (APS) showed up stating they had received a report. This leads me to believe Capital One filed a retaliatory or deflective APS report, despite knowing I had followed all procedures, provided legal documentation, and that the SSA had asked them to return the funds.\n\nTheir behavior caused unnecessary emotional distress, reputational harm, and unwarranted involvement from social services—all after I had done everything according to law."

All this got me wondering if she even needs the supplement any more.\n\nIn looking at her claims history, the sum of the policy's paid portion of her medical bills for the past 3 years is less than what 10 months of the new premium would be.\n\nTBH, I'm starting feel like she's been throwing money away for a while, and that she'll only be throwing more away on MediGap under hospice.\n\nShe's got heart disease and dementia, so there's no chance of her \"getting well\" and being forced out of hospice.\n\nIs ditching the MediGap a good thing to do at this point? I'm hoping someone has some insights on this to help me make an intelligent decision.\n\nThanks!"

My mother hasn’t left the house since the start of COVID in March 2020. She refuses to see a doctor or leave the house. The longer it goes on, the harder it is to try to get her to out. Her mental health is suffering obviously. She is lucid, though. Her feet are huge from lack of use making it hard for her to walk. She also has a growth on her face that looks like it could be melanoma. I have said many times that me or my husband would take her yo the doctor but she flat out refuses to go. \n\nAdditionally, their apartment is a mess. It’s “neat” but absolutely filthy. I am also concerned for food safety as my mom will leave things like chicken and cheese on the counter for hours before she or my dad eat it. I also suggest hiring an aide and it’s met with great resistance. \n\nMy dad is another stubborn mess but at least he goes to the doctor, takes the dog out and is on medication for his medical issues. \n\nI have a brother but he’s no contact. There’s no other family. Has anyone had any luck doing anything in a similar situation? It’s very sad to see two people who have given up and worse they’re your family. My mom especially feels like this is self-induced, could have been dealt with and now things are much worse due to fear and neglect. "

Today my wife and I had an encounter with a neighbor a few houses down from us who we've seen, but never met (who is in her 80s). She came to our door upset because she said a man had come into her house, taken her phone, and was rummaging around her garage.\n\nWe went up the street with her and called the police. They searched the house, didn't find anyone (or any evidence anyone had broken in), and found her phone on her dresser (not in the living room where she said she was charging it when it went missing/was taken). We aren't really sure what to make of it, but I told her I would check on her tomorrow as well.\n\nHer living conditions seemed good, house wasn't really cluttered, she had food in the fridge and pantry, her dog had food and seemed healthy. She was totally coherent, if a little upset. From what she told us her husband has passed, and doesn't seem to have any family living nearby. For what it's worth, she said she knocked on our door because her closer neighbor calls her crazy, =(. To be honest, we're not sure if someone was around, if she's just lonely, or has a health condition.\n\nIs there anything we should do, or someone we should call? I don't want for her to have to leave her house if she doesn't want to, but I also don't want her living in constant fear if in fact there is mental illness/declining health as the cause of what she's experiencing."

      "story": "Is this considered a crime? How do we report it without proof? Or is considered elder financial abuse or fraud?\n\nMy 73yo father owns a large plaza with both restaurant and office space units. About 80% of the units are rented out. But there’s still many empty units. It is in the state of California. \nMy father has an on-site assistant manager that works with him to manage the plaza property, communicate with tenants, collect rent, etc. etc. Her name is Edith (55F).\n\nMy father had a stroke back in Feb 2024 and has been physically incapacitated and became wheelchair bound. My family had to frantically gather together to take care of all his medical needs. And since our minds were all focused on my dad’s health, we left the plaza to be managed by Edith and my dad’s brother YC, who came from overseas to help during this time. \nAfter about 6mo of my dad recuperating and getting physical therapy, we started to get reports about the plaza from our security team and some tenants. Strange things like noises being reported from supposedly empty units in the middle of the night and when security checked, there was a full on business running there. Security suspected an illegal gambling den but not sure. When security inquired with Edith about it, she said it was nothing, just a temporary short term renter who’s going to be gone soon. By the time the family could look into it more, the renters were gone. \n\nAfter a year, Feb 2025, my father demanded to return to work at the plaza because he said we were keeping him a prisoner at home doing rehab. So we let him go back to work with Edith. We even hired on a new additional Manager to help. His name is Sean. He’s suppose to be the main manager that takes care of escalated situations at the plaza like late rent, problems, lawsuits, repair stuff. \nIt became a struggle because Edith didn’t want to relinquish many of the managerial tasks to Sean. She allowed a lot of tenants to pay rent late. And even caused a lawsuit regarding a leaking ceiling. When we tried to give Edith instructions for running the plaza, she would flat out just ignore us. That’s why we hired on Sean. \n\nAnyway, after my dad returned to the plaza part time and about 2 months in, the security team reported another incident of noises from an “empty unit” in the middle of the night again. He confronted the “tenants” this time and they said they had permission to rent the space from my father, using his name specifically. But it was not disclosed what kind of business it was. This time we asked my dad directly about it, he said he knew nothing about it. So then my dad and Sean asked Edith about it. She told them both….ohhh…,it’s a short term tenant, they’re just paying cash and will be gone soon. And there was no rental agreement/contract either. And she claimed she didn’t tell my dad nor Sean about it cuz they were all so busy. And she didn’t get around to it. But somehow she got paid “cash rent” from it and she gave that to my dad. My dad told her never to do that again and decided to just let it go and still kept employing her. \n\nHere’s our dilemma. We don’t have evidence of what exactly Edith is doing. Nor how long she’s been doing these strange temporary night-time tenants. And if she’s been pocketing the cash rent. We don’t know if my dad’s brother YC is involved or not either. The immediate family members all have their own jobs and don’t really have time to really investigate nor to gather evidence. We don’t even know how to report it as a crime. Is it even a crime? Or elder financial abuse or fraud…cuz my dad seems to just allow it to happen. Since his stroke, his logic and rationale have been somewhat compromised even though he insists it has not been. He seems to trust Edith and listen to her more than his own family members. And refuses to terminate her employment. \nI’d appreciate any input or advice. Thank you. "

For example, since the 1970s when it was opened, they hadn't installed an alarm system in the huge rec. room. (That's where  the residents are wheeled in daily for  ultra-boring activities.) But a few years ago, in a bid to escape, a male resident decided to jump over the 6-foot high fence surrounding the yard where residents are wheeled out for fresh air.\n\nEver since that guy's escape attempt, they installed an alarm which PIERCINGLY sounds off way too often, every time personnel or visitors aren't quick enough to deactivate it when anyone exits/enters-from the yard. This means that all the elderly people who are gathered in that room for \"recreation\", have been subjected to this horrible noise for the last few years. I know of two people who've become deaf since that alarm was installed. I know for a fact they weren't deaf prior to that. \n\nMost of these people aren't as sensitive as i am, thus they don't cover their ears. I myself can't tolerate the loudness, so i cover my ears, but its still torture. Note i'm a visitor, *not yet* a resident.  i'm also a nearly65 spinster, and I pray all the time for a quick death, rather than be subjected to institutionalization, due to my lifelong chronic pain conditions.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Isn't it elder-abuse to ongoingly subject disabled seniors to a piercingly loud alarm which puts them at serious risk of hearing loss, not to mention, making it more of a hassle for them to access fresh air and sun when they wish to? For sure, the original founders of this nursing home never intended for it to become as elder-hostile as it has.\n2. How best to report this, so constructive action is actually taken, not ignored? The ombudswomen would ignore me, since i'm not a relative.  Also the state senator's office have told me with respect to other complaints, that those matters were outside their jurisdiction.\n3.

He doesn't own a smartphone, just one of those old-school flip phones that may or may not be charged on any given day. 😅\n\nHe’s still sharp mentally and gets around okay, but he’s had two small falls in the past six months. Nothing serious, thank god, but it was enough to make me realize he needs *something* in case he can’t get to a phone or yells for help and no one hears him. He has no Alexa, no smart home stuff, and the idea of wearing an Apple Watch makes him roll his eyes. (“I don’t need one of those gadgets telling me I’m dead when I’m not.”)\n\nI’ve been researching medical alert buttons, fall detection, panic buttons, etc., and it’s kind of overwhelming. Most of them call 911, which he absolutely does NOT want unless it’s life-or-death. He’s made it very clear he doesn’t want paramedics showing up for a “stubbed toe.” He just wants something simple: push a button, and it contacts me or my cousin who lives two streets away.\n\nThe idea I’m toying with is maybe a WiFi-based device or even a physical button that notifies family, not emergency services. I came across Ring's panic buttons (I already use their doorbell + cameras at my own house), and I’m wondering if I could rig something like that to notify me without triggering the police or EMS right away.\n\nI don’t think he’d carry anything, but he might be okay with having a couple of physical buttons on the wall or on a table that are just “press if something happens” type things.\n\nMy wish list:\n\n1. Simple, one-button emergency contact (me, cousin, maybe a neighbor)\n2. No 911 involved unless absolutely needed\n3. Something with a loud speaker or audio feedback if possible\n4. WiFi or cellular based (he doesn’t have landline)\n5. Needs to be brain-dead simple like, this man still has a rotary phone in a closet “just in case”\n\nAny of you in a similar situation with an elderly parent, grandparent, or relative who’s stubborn or tech-averse?

Her husband, George, passed away late last year, and since then things have become increasingly complicated and honestly quite heartbreaking.\n\n\n\nA few years ago, during COVID, my family lost a lot of direct contact with Helen because we were dealing with our grandmother’s declining health and eventually her passing. Around that same time, a neighbour (we’ll call her Linda) started “helping out” with Helen and George – shopping, errands, etc. Over time, Linda seems to have become the central person in Helen’s life.\n\n\n\nHere’s the problem:\n\n\n\nLinda never introduced herself to us, never made an effort to say “Hi, I’m helping them, just wanted you to know.”\n\n\n\nWe didn’t even know of her existence until George was dying.\n\n\n\nAfter his death, we found out that Helen had been moved into a care home, and no one told us. We had to track her down ourselves.\n\n\n\nLinda blocks communication, keeps control of Helen’s finances (with others under POA), and refuses to provide transparency about what’s happening.\n\n\n\nWe recently found Christmas cards we sent still unopened, and there are no family photos in her room – just photos and tokens from Linda.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven worse, Linda claims George didn’t want us involved, and that we’re “evil” for questioning her role. But we loved George and Helen. We’ve shared years of memories with them, and it kills me to think George may have died believing we didn’t care – something that couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\n\n\nWe’ve involved solicitors, but Linda has been spinning a narrative that she’s the only one who’s ever cared, while blocking us from seeing basic things like bank statements to confirm Helen’s finances are secure.\n\n\n\nWe live four hours away, so while we haven’t been there daily, we’ve always been present emotionally and tried to stay connected, especially before COVID. Distance doesn’t mean we care any less, but it has allowed Linda to take control unchecked.\n\n\n\nI met with the care home manager recently, and even she seemed surprised by what I had to say, but everything in the system so far leans towards “if Helen says she’s fine, she’s fine.” But I don’t believe Helen’s choices are fully her own. She’s vulnerable, easily swayed, and tells whoever’s in the room what they want to hear.\n\n\n\nI also have to admit – Helen has always loved being the centre of attention. I think she enjoys some of this dynamic, but that doesn’t mean she’s not being manipulated or isolated. It makes it harder because she may be complicit to a point, but still at risk.\n\n\n\nHere’s what I’m struggling with:\n\n\n\nWhy can no one else see this? Why is it so obvious to us, her family, from afar, but those close to her – neighbours, care staff, safeguarding teams – seem blind to it?\n\n\n\nHow do I prove undue influence or financial abuse when she seems “compos mentis” but is clearly in a controlled environment?\n\n\n\nHas anyone had success challenging a POA or getting proper adult safeguarding action taken in situations like this?\n\n\n\nHave you ever dealt with a self-serving person inserting themselves into a vulnerable relative’s life and effectively taking over?\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel stuck. Nobody is listening, and we’re being painted as the bad guys just for wanting to protect Helen and be part of her life again.\n\n\n\nAny advice, similar experiences, or just support would mean a lot right now.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading."

My father rarely leaves the house so recently when we visited his primary I asked about the reminders.  His doc (who is amazing, btw) said yes, he should get vaccinated because at his age it would be deadly if he picked up either of those illnesses.  They gave him the pneumonia vaccine that day and said RSV isn’t covered my Medicare so he needs to get it elsewhere.  He rarely leaves the house.  \n\nI mentioned this to his health care worker who made a big deal about how chilly my dad was over his pneumonia vaccine—which subsided in a few hours.  I’m starting to think she’s anti-vax which we as a family, are not.   \n\nNow, she said he doesn’t need the RSV because he’s not around “little ones.”  Okay, fine.  The next moment, she told me how she referred someone to the agency to be a potential worker (great!  She sounds caring and nice!) but this person has “little ones.”  \n\nIs anyone up to date on RSV that could chime in?  I’m having trouble understanding if my father is at risk or not.

I had to explain that some meds are meant for night time and that doses are different on his dialysis days.\n\nI asked him if I could set up a notification on his Amazon Echo the way my husband had done for himself. A nightly reminder that triggers the same time each night: \"Here is your reminder, take your meds\". \n\nIt's working.

      "story": "This was an interesting visit. My husband (71M, retired, having health issues) and I (67F, working FT, no health issues yet) are preparing for my retirement. We lost it all in 2008 and have somewhat recovered. Not a bad loan situation; rather a new career started by me in 2006 as an older person. In 2008 the layoffs started. I am the breadwinner.\n\nI saw on this subreddit that finding out what to do in case of the need for LTC is something that should be investigated. So today we saw an attorney.\n\nWe each have SS and a smallish pension. He is collecting; I am not. I have two investment properties in GA in LLCs. We have a trailer we live in, in MA. In MA a trailer on rented land is personal property, not real estate. \n\nShe said in my home state we could do a Medicaid Trust. In MA the spouse can keep a home (real estate, not personal property) plus $160K of cash and personal property. The trailer is worth more than $160K. It is not real estate.\n\nWe bought in GA because family is there and we planned to move there. Now my family has moved closer, to Philadelphia, which I’m thrilled about. Now I plan to sell in GA and buy real estate near my family.\n\nThe attorney suggested I meet with a PA elder care attorney. She said PA might not reach across state lines to take personal property, which would mean I could keep my trailer.\n\nDoes anyone know which state is better for retirement and the need for a Medicaid plan? PA, Delaware or MA? Probably not MA!\n\nThe attorney suggested simplifying and selling. I had been focusing on income streams, but being a landlord is a pain. I like the idea of simplifying. \n\nHer case was I can only keep one piece of real estate, if my husband needs LTC, and vice versa. \n\nNow we are trying to find out which state will be better, PA or Delaware. I cannot afford a house where we live in MA.\n\nAny input is welcomed.\n\n\n\n"

      "title": "My Mom's Mind is Slipping Away After Surgery. And Medicaid Will Take the House.",
      "story": "I don't really know where to start with this. I have no idea what to do for her or myself. A few weeks back my mom who is 65 fell and broke her hip. She is a alcoholic and a chain smoker, she also barely ate and weighed 80lbs. I tried to get her to eat more for years now. (I lived with and helped take care of her.)\n\nWhen she broke her hip I called 911 and got her a ambulance. They came quickly and took her away. I stayed home since I had work in the morning and she thought she was going to be fine and I could visit her after work the next day. Well later that night at around 12 in the morning there is a knock on the door. It's a uber driver carrying my mom. (Why an uber driver you ask? Because the EMT's did not take her phone I tried to give her and she can't remember my number without it so she had to rely on the kindness of strangers to get home.) I get her in the house and to her bed and she tells me they said they found nothing wrong and called it arthritis. Well, they were wrong, she got a call from her primary the next day telling her it was a fracture on her right hip. So she goes back to the hospital, this would be the last time I had seen my mom in a lucid state.\n\nThe next day I get a call from her to tell me she is home and wondering how much longer I will be at work. Thing is, she is still there at the hospital and I am home. I laugh it off thinking its the anesthesia and I tell her I will see her soon and that I love her. Next day comes and I find out she is not at the hospital but already been sent to rehab. I call to talk to her and I cant. She is unresponsive. This is the start of a long mess where she cant feed herself and everyone just places food next to her table. The place is called Ignite and it was horrible. Needless to say she ends up getting sick due to lack of care and goes back to the hospital again. \n\nThis stay ended up being for pneumonia. She is out of it for a few days before waking up. Once up she is still very confused, very not okay. At this point it's been two weeks since she had a drink and I figure it was withdrawal. But another weeks passes and she is still confused. She seemed slightly more coherent, and was able to eat and feed herself, but still delusional. Eventually, they send her home. \n\nNow I am there with her when she gets home and I take a few days off to take closer care of her. Her first night seemed pretty good. She was still a bit out of it but she knew where she was, knew who she was, who I was, who our dog was. I get her in bed and tuck her in for the night and go to bed myself. But I wake up to her laying on the floor and talking to two \"gentlemen\" as she put it standing on the living room table. She is trying to make a deal with them and her dead sister... Naturally I was very concerned. She continued to be like this for the next three days before I get her in respite care where she is now. This is what a home hospice service her medicare has provided us does so I can work. Its five days of care a week. \n\nAnyway, now I am trying to go through her mountains of saved papers to find things for her, deal with the bank, trying to claim guardianship, get the house cleaned up finally, and get her more permanent care. She only has me and her last living sister. We are it. But I found out today if we get her the care she needs through Medicaid, (Not medicare) they will put a lean on her house. This house I grew up in, the one she spent the later half of her adult life trying to build up and paid off, the house I spent my entire adult life trying to help her maintain and pay off. They want to take it. I still live here, pay the bills, and the only reason she invested in it was to leave it to me. \n\nI don't know what to do here, I don't know where to turn. I am scared for my mom who suddenly lost her mind. I am worried that all her effort to secure a legacy to leave her only son is going to be stolen from her. I am on a more selfish note worried about losing the only home I ever truly knew. I am furious, scared, exhausted, and utterly at a loss. I guess I just needed a place to vent and hopefully find some advice because I am really done in here. Maybe this isn't the right place for it though. \n\n"

Despite that, my wife and I made the decision to sell our home and move into a dual-family dwelling with him, along with our two very young kids, to help care for him. He’s not particularly old, but his health is poor.\n\nWe gave up some freedoms in the move, but financially it’s manageable — he charges us below-market rent, and my wife receives some caregiver support payments as well.\n\nHe’s now facing a high-risk surgery, and we were advised to get all the legal paperwork sorted — wills, power of attorney, etc. I already handle a lot of his affairs, so it made sense for me to take the lead. I found a lawyer, organised the paperwork, arranged his transport, and took him to the appointment.\n\nThen he named my sister as power of attorney.\n\nShe lives 3–4 hours away and, while she talks to him often on the phone, she only visits a few times a year.  And he gives her money because he believes were benefiting of living with him while and she shouldn't miss out. Meanwhile, I’m the one here on the ground — handling the day-to-day, stepping in constantly, adjusting my family’s life to support him. He is such a source of stress.\n\nI know I shouldn’t be bothered. I understand. I’m practical, I’m pragmatic. And we’ve clashed in the past — usually, I just give in, even when I know I’m right because it’s not worth the fight.\n\nBut this… this has me riled up.

      "title": "This seems almost unreal!",
      "story": "I need advice. My 85-year-old dad was a victim of fiduciary elder abuse by two men who became handymen after my mom passed away in 2020. One of their sisters, a real estate agent, seduced him and moved into the house he had bought for $500,000, significantly higher than any online estimates. She convinced him to offer $2 million, which he did, despite the high-end suggested offer being $1.4 million. She then secretly moved in, lied to his family for two months while they started dating, and actively avoided meeting me as his girlfriend for almost six months. She stopped selling houses because she had found her “unicorn.”\n\nIn a year, my dad aged 15, bought two sports cars, crafted one on a hit-and-run, and recently purchased her a $800,000 condo that he called a loan without a contract. He also gave her lump sums of cash, took her on vacations, and she used his home for extravagant parties, isolating him from his family. My girls and I lived with my dad and mom for 11 years, so I know him better than anyone else. I’m certain he’s terrified.\n\nBefore I continue, I want to emphasize that we are not the Rockefellers, and my father is not a multi-millionaire. He had built modest wealth with my mother, and she protected both her legacy and her family with unwavering dedication. In fact, she was so strict that she used to put my dad on an allowance. It seems that he had no idea how to manage money once he gained full control, and he was like a child in a candy store.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I called adult protective services to file a report on this woman and what I believe is a case of elder abuse. I’m concerned that she should be removed from this family and that she has taken a significant amount from my father. Not to mention the mental, emotional, and even physical abuse he appears to be enduring. And supposedly they came out and met with my father last week as well as the sheriffs department and I guess they met with her too. I think there’s a second interview set up, but here’s my question. How can I get information?\nDo I get to be privy to the details since I filed the report and what is the process from here on forward. oh one more important side note: the brother that is part of this, turns out I come to learn after I move out of my father‘s house the man is a convicted pedophile With a conviction of a lewd lascivious act with a child under 14.  Well of course I was horrified.! And when I told my father, his reaction was so bizarre and not normal that i knew something was very wrong. Because he sounded terrified to even confront this man and said he would never, could never, because he would risk losing him as a best friend. Never mind the fact that he had put himself in front of my children on the sex offender registry. This response was so out of character for my dad I started then looking much closer into all three of them. I think he pays them all in cash and he’s been doing this with the two men for 4 years and with the woman for one, though by my calculations in that one year she has taken over 1.5 million from him and does not seem to be slowing down. Nothing she has offered as to who she is has been true, and she has no ability  to pay my father back. Unfortunately for him, she has no legal obligation either. I am curious what the options for us still. I am at a loss on options at this point and I feel both helpless and hopeless. But what happened  two days ago has me throwing up my hands and about to leave all the wolves to each other. After the social worker visit (this was 2 days after the sheriffs visit) I just truly feel there must be some recourse that could help me get her and these guys away from him. I wish I could get updated from social services but if anyone has any information or advice that might be helpful, this stressed out daughter would be grateful. \n\nEdit: My father is 86 and this woman is 59"

His basic monthly bills + a financed vehicle has him about $300 in the red before food, gasoline, or anything else.\nAs my mother was dying, we (2 brothers and our wives) tried to help make a financial plan for my father's future to which he was aggressively against. We washed our hands of it and did the best we could.\nFast forward 3 months: My father blew through 28k+ and was, unbeknownst to my siblings and me, living on his SS + high interest personal loans / payday advances. We banded together to pay off and told him never again would we help him financially. Tried to get him to live within his means and he seemed to \"get it\".\nFast forward to 2 weeks ago. My brother discovered he hasn't paid any utilities in 4 months and hasn't paid his mortgage in 2 months.\nHe has  DHS account as he receives food assistance ($52/mo) and we applied for SER to pay his utilities and catch his mortgage up.\nDespite our best efforts, he was denied. \nWe plan to appeal and have a plan B to make payment arrangements he can afford with the utilities, but his mortgage will be a problem to catch up.  \nA few years ago, he was able to secure a home improvement loan through the county and, in lieu of traditional payments, they put a $30k lien on his home. He has a 2.75% interest rate, but only, maybe 60k in equity before the lien. Anything we can think of to do with the home will not net him enough to better his situation because it will either significantly raise his interest rate (and payment) or trigger a repayment of his home improvement lien.\nHe has poor leg circulation which makes walking / standing difficult on top of multiple myeloma which effects his bones and acts like osteoporosis in his case, so working is out of the question. \nWe cannot afford to pay his bills and are really out of options. We're looking for advise on how to proceed. He makes about $600 more than 150% of the poverty line yearly so his state options are basically non-existent.\nHis only assets thst are worth anything are currently up for sale, but that will net him less than 10k - a band-aid in our opinion."

My 95-year-old Grandma, who I storyed about recently (who was possibly having blind peoples' hallucinations), got much worse very quickly. She went from being completely sane to living in her own world in about 2-3 weeks. I last saw her on Sunday, she was confused about where she was, kept asking me where pieces of furniture were relative to her, but was otherwise coherent. \n\nFrom what I heard, on Tuesday, one minute she was well enough, and the next minute it suddenly became difficult for her to even sit up, and her mind went completely (screaming at the top of her lungs for police, etc.). It has not returned since. She is in the hospital since then, but I only learned about this Thursday evening, and only visited today. She seemed to be knocked out by medicine, and there was nothing we could do for her, but I learned from her children and the hospital room neighbors that when she wakes up (usually during the night), she wreaks havoc, shouts about how she is kidnapped and other incoherent things and tries to get up and go somewhere. \n\nWhen my aunt visited later today, it seems like Grandma was having an episode again, and apparently it was so bad that my aunt (grandma's primary caretaker, who does the brunt of the work and I don't know how she's not crazy yet at this point) said she is too exhausted from it all to come visit Grandma tomorrow. My dad said he's not sure if he'll visit also, I think he has a hard time with emotions and it's difficult for him to see this, and that also he may be scared he won't know what to do if he catches Grandma during an \"episode\".\n\nDad also keeps reminding me there is nothing we can do for Grandma while she is in the hospital. Which is true I guess. She gets taken care of well by the nurses there. I don't know what I'd do if I saw her during a manic episode. I have an anxiety disorder myself and if it really gets as bad as it sounds, I am not sure if it wouldn't have a lasting negative effect on my own mental health. I dread seeing her like this. But also... I dread the idea of her being alone with nobody visiting her. I have this weird imagining that seeing me might even snap her back a bit (we had a good relationship, and in the weeks leading up to this, I'd be quite successful in calming her down). And also... I don't want to feel until the end of my life that I did something wrong during my Grandma's last days.\n\nI am in my late 20s, and my other grandparents died before I was old enough to bare any burden in their caretaking, so this is a first for me.

      "title": "Elder Care Employment- Red Flags?",
      "story": "**tl;dr: I applied for a job at an eldercare facility and I think my last two \"interviews\" raised some red flags.**\n\nI'm interviewing for a part-time concierge/receptionist position at a facility offering independent living, assisted living, and memory care. This would be my first job in this field. I have an arts background but also experience working with adults with elder care, so the nature of the job doesn’t concern me. The facility is just a block from my home, which is a big plus since I need a second job to supplement my current part-time gig where I have a lengthy commute. I could roll out of bed and be at work in 5 minutes. That's how close.\n\nHowever, I’ve noticed some potential red flags. I applied on Tuesday and got a call the next day. The person was polite but asked very little about my resume or experience, just confirmed the years at my last job and asked if I’m comfortable in a memory care setting. She jumped to asking about my availability, which I’ve seen at other jobs as a sign they need someone ASAP, which is fine. However, she sounded very rushed, which is a red flag in general.\n\nToday, the facility manager called, and it was more of the same, mostly focused on my hours. Neither call included questions about my background, whether I understood the job, or anything beyond the Indeed listing. While both callers were polite, this feels off. Shouldn’t a healthcare-related employer ask more to ensure I’m a good fit and will be safe to work with? I was asked if I could meet with the director and said I could even meet same day, but the director wouldn't be in until Monday. I still don't know my schedule from my other job, so I offered to contact the second caller as soon as I had my schedule and we could move forward. The call ended on what sounded like a positive note, but the person on the other end seemed passive. Further, this may not be a red flag, but after she said that this job paid minimum wage (also fine), I asked what the minimum wage was, she said she was unsure. This back to back with the absence of salary listing on their Indeed storys seems weird. How do you not know what the minimum wage is?\n\nI researched reviews: the facility changed management two years ago. Most positive reviews are from the previous company, and recent ones are split 50/50. It’s part of a chain, so many reviews are from out-of-state locations (e.g., Ohio, Florida). I found only two for my state: one good, one bad. So it’s hard to judge.\n\nI already have a part-time job I want to keep. The memory care place pressed me for set days I could commit to, but I won’t know my other schedule until April 21st. The manager seemed frustrated when I couldn’t lock in dates on the spot. I promised to call back once I have my other schedule, but the urgency felt odd. Further, that I was expected to be on call to pick up shifts during the week. I said I could do that on the days I'm assigned to work (the position is evening), but couldn't guarantee the rest of the week. In most interviews I've done, the employer at least tries to sell me on the story before figuring out if I'm worth proceeding with. The shift pickup part comes after I've landed the job. You're not selling it well otherwise. And why should I be on call for a PT job?\n\nI’ve worked sketchy jobs before and can tolerate a lot, but I’m at a point where I want a safe, non-toxic workplace where I can work without constant anxiety. For those with experience in this field, are these red flags a dealbreaker, or should I give it a shot? Thanks for reading!"

He has soiled himself and his bedding multiple times. The room smells like feces, and the bedding hasn’t been cleaned or changed. He’s unable to properly bathe or manage basic hygiene, and I’ve had to clean up the bathroom multiple times already. He's showered only twice in the 2 months I've been here and never changed his linens until yesterday when I threw a fit about the smell.\n\nI’ve reported this to my case manager, who said her “hands are tied.” When I brought it up to another staff member, I was told, “You don’t have to stay here if you don’t like it.” His granddaughter visited recently and said he “just likes to be alone,” but no one seems to be addressing the fact that he’s living in his own waste—and I’m being forced to live in that environment too. He is eating spoiled rotten food and thinks that it's ok. I'm being forced to watch this man do all of these things and I feel like I need to report it and I'm growing resentment because I'm tired of living in his filth. Advice please!!"

I have this great big family (dad, uncles, adult cousins) who’s all relatively local, or at least as the means and time to travel states to visit my 91 YO grandmother- who has significantly gone down hill lately. \n\nI (27f granddaughter) just started working in the caregiving field around the same time my grandmother had a hospital stay and a really rough transition home. My family basically said “PERFECT! You’re trained in this, you take care of her”. \n\nThey are paying me to do so, and I really love my grandmother and get along great so I was happy to do so.

      "story": "My parents died 3 years ago, and shortly after that my aunt, my father's older sister, Ruth, sent me POA/Healthcare proxy forms, bc my father had previously been that person. She lives near nyc. My younger sister and I are her only relatives and since I am older, plus I live 3 hours upstate and my sister is much farther away down south. Our relationship has always been good, but mostly a holidays/ phone calls thing. We've known for a long time we are her heirs bc she never married or had kids. She's now 83.\n\nSo 3 weeks ago I got a call from a hospital. Ruth has been in for a week, it took them this long to reach me bc she kept giving them a phone number I haven't had for ten years. I talked to her at Christmas, she has my number and my husband's. She's been diagnosed with dementia and a few other issues. The hospital won't let her leave unless it's to a nursing home or home with a full time aide. She refuses to acknowledge the dementia, refuses nursing home, when they told her an aide wouldn't be covered by insurance she said \"I have money\" so I went down and arranged the aide, which left her in the hospital 3 more days due to a weekend.\n\nShe does have money. She owns several rental properties out west. They're run by management companies, they mail her checks totalling abt $9000 every month. Plus the usual social security and a small pension. Unfortunately she tells this to everyone, which could invite problems. She lives in a one bedroom rent controlled apartment for $800/mo, owns a 10yo hyundai, spends little. So there's money.\n\nShe has two live in aides that switch out every 4 days and she can't tell them apart, ugh. They're both Black girls in their 20s, but other than that not that similar so that's kind of embarrassing, but both have assured me that compared to other folks they've cared for she's very easy to work with. \n\nHer dementia is not alzheimer's, it's caused by a disease I won't get into, has been treated, actually might not get worse anytime soon, but damage has been done and there won't be any improvement. It's mostly short term memory, like shes forgotten the last two years. She's said repeatedly my dad died a year ago, it's been 3 years. She has a chronic anemia she needs weekly platelet infusions for. When I took her to that appointment this week, she didn't know where to go (big hospital). They happened to give me her chart, she's been going for this procedure weekly for almost 3 years and doesn't remember. Until early February, when she started forgetting about it, probably causing the lightheadedness that sent her to the hospital. \n\nThe checks for her rentals come in the mail. We have found 3 of them she forgot to deposit. Who loses a $8000 check? We've been to her main bank, shown the POA papers, I have access to her accounts. She's still writing checks for her bills, there's several affiliated with her rentals, it's her favorite activity actually, though her checkbook isn't quite balanced. She's mostly just not accounting for things that are auto deducted like the aide agency. She has another bank but it's smaller, I don't have a branch locally. I assume that's where her ss is being deposited bc I can't find a trace of that. I assume when we get around to going there she'll have no problem giving me access. \n\nThe aides do make sure she eats, bathes, help her go to the store across the street, but other than daily living they're kind of useless. They're sweet girls but just in case, I'm just leaving her with a couple hundred bucks. She has her checkbook and a couple cards she uses for shopping, if something happens I can fraud alert those.\n\nThey apparently aren't allowed to dish out her meds, just remind her to take them, so every week I have to fill the little boxes. They also don't drive (nyc) and apparently arranging a ride isn't in their job description, so I either have to go down there 3 hours to take her to appts or remotely arrange an uber, which is a pain cause uber drivers tend to be impatient. The aides do accompany her to appointments, help her get in the car, etc. Ruth has multiple Dr appts during the week, I have to keep track of them. This will go down to a couple a week soon, they're a result of her hospital stay.\n\nRuth owns a perfectly acceptable car she is not allowed to drive, has said she doesn't mind others driving it, if they gave her an aide with a license they could drive her places but that doesn't seem to be possible from the highest rated home Healthcare agency in the area. The car is currently parked at the grocery store across the street from her, I move it every couple days so they don't think it's abandoned. I offered to bring it upstate and put in my driveway but she has a crazy idea she'll get her license back. Finally a Dr told her this week to sell it (which we can't do immediately, the title is in a safe deposit box but she doesn't remember which one) but if she doesn't forget she did agree to let me take it upstate, hopefully this week I can bring my husband and do that.\n\nMy problem isn't really money. She can afford this, she insists on giving me tons of money to compensate my time, motel, the car I had to rent this week bc one of mine is in the shop. It's that I live 3 hours away and have to take her to every Dr appt, to do her banking, etc. I am hoping to get her to have the checks/bills mailed to me, I would have no problem taking care of her shit from here. I don't have a normal job or kids, that would make this impossible. I have a business selling things I make and have a pile of neglected work. My husband has difficulty taking care of himself, let alone our 7 rescue cats(not really. Just typical male incompetence).\n\nRuth really should be in some kind of assisted living but is extremely against the idea. Where she lives there is a grocery store across the street, several restaurants, a story office, a branch of her bank(though she prefers to go to one a couple towns over). I had almost convinced her bc her apt is on the third floor and the stairs are unsafe. Then her super informed her there's a free apartment on the ground floor. Great. She's in process of arranging to move there. She won't have rent control there, so the $2200/mo rent + $3300/wk for the aide will be paid for by all her income and she'll have to tap savings. Blech.\n\nMy days the last few weeks are either driving or making phone calls on her behalf. Yes I want to be at some of her appts but some I don't need to be at, like the weekly infusion she's been getting for years. Isn't there somebody that can take of some of this? Am I screwed bc she's not poor? I know there are senior transport services in my community but nobody down there knows anything about them, does someone need to be on medicaid to use them? She's not particularly physically disabled. Until this happened she played tennis a couple times a week, Dr says that's OK but she has no way to get there. Having had a car her whole life she has no idea(and no smartphone) how to get a cab, uber,etc and the aides won't do it. I can't continue to go down to this city 3× a week, 3hrs away, and maintain my health and sanity. Like I have no problem managing her money, Healthcare decisions, etc remotely, or visiting like every other week or so, but I can't continue what's happening indefinitely. \n\nMy hb used to (and still does privately, for one client) work for an agency that did the services I need, but for young disabled adults. He picked them up and helped them run errands and do fun things. He looks at my struggle and says, she needs a service coordinator. Yes, but all his clients were on medicaid and Ruth is way too well off for that."

It is, most likely, something called Charles Bonnet syndrome, which happens to visually impaired people, the best I can understand it is it's when their brain does not receive the visual input it's expecting, so it essentially makes up its own stuff. (She is being checked for other possible causes, but nothing has come up so far). As far as I've seen, there is no known definitive treatment.\n\nInitially, she could understand very well that what she is seeing is not real. But now, as time passes by, I think the hallucinations have exhausted her, and she has reached the point where she is constantly trying to grab them to see if they're real and talks to them (like, shell be alone in a room and start saying \"shoo/go away/leave me alone\"). She mostly sees random strangers sitting around her room, or junk piled around her, and one time she started thinking she was being boxed up and buried. It's causing her a lot of distress. I saw her call a friend and start talking about how these weird creatures are attacking her, only explaining it's due to her visual impairment a few sentences later.\n\nHas anyone dealt with an elder who was experiencing this?

They’ve lived in their current house for 28 years. \n\nFor the past year he has been falling frequently. In public and at home, in the shower and in the middle of the night. My grandma has also noticed signs of dementia. She had mentioned it to his daughters (who rarely see him) but they didn’t do anything. My grandma went out of town and one daughter came to stay with him, that’s when she noticed he was acting weird and took him to the hospital. \n\nSince he’s been at the rehab facility he’s been a nightmare. He’s falling there too. They had to put a tent over his bed. He’s been physical with them and kicked a nurse in the chest. He has a long history with violence. Has been to prison for it. As far as we know he hasn’t hit my grandma but I’ve heard him be verbally abusive to her. He is definitely abusive to animals. He’s crippled now but still capable of hurting her. \n\nHis dementia has gotten worse and the rehab facility suggested he go to a memory care unit. His daughter though, is insisting he go back home to my grandma. She has pleaded with the social worker and his daughter that she can’t take care of him. She admitted he probably got the brain bleed by falling in her care. She is a very small woman, and she’s 88. My aunt is going over today to hide all of the guns in case he does come back home. He is quite crippled now but who knows what he’s capable of. He can get up and walk a bit but he falls. \n\nI’m just really scared for my grandmother.

      "story": "I’m trying to get some clarity and legal perspective on a situation that feels deeply wrong. I’ll keep this general for privacy reasons, but any guidance or thoughts would be incredibly appreciated. Using a burner account because I don’t want this to end up with some family issues if it gets discovered.\n\nMy elderly father, who has some cognitive decline but is still fairly active, had been living in a long-term care facility with his wife, who has severe memory loss. They’ve been together for decades and had been managing relatively well together in care—until recently.\n\nA few months back, things started escalating. Staff at the facility reported that my father was becoming “verbally abusive”—for example, when reminded to use a walker, he told them to mind their own “goddamn business.” This kind of outburst, while not ideal, doesn’t seem out of the ordinary for someone in his condition, especially when he’s frustrated and disoriented.\n\nThen one morning at breakfast, his wife (who has near-constant memory resets) reached for food on his plate. He reacted by swatting her hand away—not violently, just instinctively. Staff documented the incident. Days later, another situation occurred where he apparently grabbed her arm. A relative who was visiting ran to get the staff, and they ended up calling the police.\n\nPolice came and he was taken for a psych evaluation. He was cleared—but kept in the psych ward for nearly a week with no access to a phone or outside communication. Meanwhile, his wife (who depends on him emotionally) rapidly deteriorated without him around.\n\nAfter that, they said he was no longer allowed back to the original facility. He was moved to a new nursing home. Here’s where it gets strange: the new facility had no record of any previous “violence” or behavior issues. They also had no idea that he had a spouse—no mention of it in his intake paperwork. Staff were visibly surprised that such a significant part of his life had been completely omitted.\n\nNow, he’s being told that staying apart from his wife is “for her own good” and that if he cooperates and settles in, he might be allowed to see her again at some point. But she’s not improving—she’s declining faster without him around.\n\nThe relative who’s been overseeing everything lives locally. I’m out of state and only recently started digging into what’s really going on. At first I believed the version of events I was told, but now I’m seeing major gaps, missing documentation, and decisions made without proper transparency or advocacy for my father.\n\nI’m looking for guidance on the following:\n\n\n•\tCan a care facility in Oklahoma legally separate spouses and bar one from returning based on relatively minor incidents, especially when dementia is involved?\n\n\n•\tWas it lawful to hold him in psych for days without contact, even after being cleared?\n\n\n•\tShould I be speaking to Adult Protective Services, a lawyer, or both?\n\n\n•\tHow do I make sure his side of the story is being represented in this process?\n\n\n•\tIs there any legal or ethical recourse to challenge what seems like an unjust separation and possibly an attempt to keep the spouses permanently apart?\n\nThis situation feels ethically wrong and possibly legally questionable. I want to make sure I do the right thing while there’s still time to help both of them.\n\nThanks for reading—any direction or shared experience is truly appreciated.\n"

They each have social security and my father’s military pension they are living off of.  They’re listed together on the mortgage for their home, which they’ve owned since the late 1990s. My father has refused to pay the V.A. mortgage loan for over seven months, and now they’re facing foreclosure. My mom just found out this month, finding a mortgage reinstatement letter my dad tried to hide from her while she was cleaning. The total reinstatement amount is $9,034.57, due by April 4th, 2025. I called their mortgage company and found out it’s in active foreclosure and a sale date can be set any day now. When it’s finally set, they said my parents will have 30 days to vacate the property.\n\nHere’s the most frustrating part: they have the money. There’s over $4,000 in their bank account and $4000 in overpayments to utility companies. But my mom’s name is not on the utilities, so she can’t request refunds, and she has no access to the account where his military retirement checks are deposited. He refuses to share the account or allow anyone to help.\n\nThere may be some mental health issues at play. He’s become extremely paranoid — convinced people are trying to steal from him — and spends hundreds weekly in unnecessary groceries that go uneaten. He hoards grocery purchases and has the home overwhelmed with hundreds of unopened Amazon packages. He hasn’t left the house in years and refuses to talk to anyone. When my mom begged him to let her or me (their adult daughter) help pay the mortgage, he got angry and said to let the bank take the house.\n\nI’m in the process of speaking with an attorney about conservatorship, but not sure if that’s the correct thing to do. He will be very angry and be an unsafe environment when he finds out we are filing for that.  My mom has a small savings to cover the $2,000 shortfall to bring the mortgage current when used with the funds mentioned above but she can’t access the rest of the funds or request the utility refunds because of how everything is in his name.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something like this — when one spouse’s irrational behavior and mental health issues puts both at risk of losing their home? Any advice on legal steps, delaying foreclosure, or how to work with the lender during this time would be incredibly appreciated. The lender recommended applying for the hardship programs they have but I feel they won’t qualify for these type of programs or loan modifications because they absolutely have the funds to pay. My father has become uncooperative and would refuse to sign anything as well for assistance."

That will be my preferred method.

I know people have said this before but I still wasn't totally sure. He said there have been only two instances he's aware of where the information needed to be shared: once when subpoenaed and the other when the person's doctor had filled out the form. \n\nHe provided insight on the process. It is very clear. After DMV receives the request, these are the sequence of steps: \n\n1. My dad would need to get clearance from his doctor that they are ok to drive. (This is huge!

She only speaks respectfully on grandma’s birthday or in front of friends/family, but most family except those who live further away or even overseas avoids her (there are other reasons I won't get into though).\n\nWhen I try to discuss her behavior, she demands I ignore her 5 minute TED Talks (/s) to grandma, then deflects by \"reminding\" me that I'm heading back to the US in May, says we can go no-contact again, projects it as if I hate/resent them on a personal level, starts arguments and DARVOs me until I decide it's no longer worth the effort to say anything and she thinks she won, and also would threaten to remove my inheritance and donate her assets if I'm not compliant (which I'm not after her money).\n\nShe justifies yelling at grandma as catharsis and sees it as a victimless crime since she won't remember (but doesn't consider that she's in the same house as someone who can remember), and also directly say that she doesn't retain things when I confront her, yet paradoxically turns around and talks to my grandma as if she CAN remember things... For example, she'll yell, \"You've lived here so long, and you don't know where the guard shack is?\" when grandma often says things consistent with not remembering she lives there, instead of simply saying \"turn left\".\n\nHow is she miserly? She lives in a 3rd-floor condo with no elevator and insists on walking grandma up and down the stairs, despite the fact that it's getting harder for them to do so, and she could simply rent our condo out and live elsewhere without affecting her home equity. When asked what she'd do if grandma lost mobility, she said she'd leave her bedridden since \"all she does is sleep anyway\". She also refused to get grandma dentures, following a dentist's poor advice to use her remaining teeth that was probably semi-valid when it was given, but now I seriously doubt if it still applies, since it wouldn't surprise me if she's gnawing on her gums to chew at this point; she already barely has any teeth left, and already lost at least 3-4 teeth in the 1.5 years I've been on this island.\n\nI'd expand to more details, but I didn't sleep well last night, both writing most of this rant and still having insomnia until at least 1 AM, and can't even think clearly right now, and while I'm sure I can expand on it otherwise, I think I covered enough major points above. I have some recordings I've made in recent months in case evidence is needed, but I'm hoping things turn around.\n\nThank you for hearing me out and letting me vent a bit.\n\nEDIT: Added some details, but also ran segments through AI to shorten it a bit."

      "title": "I don’t want to overstep my bounds but my partner’s mother needs help at home and my partner isn’t doing anything about it.",
      "story": "Background: my partner’s mother lives by herself, 5 hours away. In the past year or so her behavior has gotten unusual. For example, she keeps turning the refrigerator off. She puts her food outside to keep it cold, and in the summer she puts it in a neighbor’s fridge. She turns it off because she says “it’s running too much.” She no longer drives her car (but claims she does). Instead of going to the grocery store, she’ll walk down to the gas station to buy milk, bread and bologna. She was walking around in the dead of winter with large holes in her shoes so my partner sent her new sneakers. When he visited her last week, she was still wearing the worn-out shoes and had no memory of receiving new shoes. Her basement flooded last week which my partner only found out about bc on the phone his mom mentioned in passing that her “feet were covered with water.” He rushed to her house, ripped up the carpet, patched up the problem areas, installed a sum pump and bought two dehumidifiers. He just talked to her now and discovered she’d unplugged the dehumidifiers and the sum pump. She insists she didn’t (she did). When I ask him what he’s going to do about this, he shrugs his shoulders and basically says, “Not sure what I can do.” Money is not a problem for his mother. She can afford to have help. It’s only a matter of time before something catastrophic happens. When I even delicately suggest researching options (not a “home,” just help), he snaps at me and says I’m stressing him out. His inaction is making me crazy. How can I help move this situation forward? She needs help. Or do I just mind my own business and listen to him rant about “you’ll never believe what my mom just did…”?"

      "story": "My husband’s parents are in their 80s, have zero savings and are living on SS. They are still living independently.\n\nMy husband loves his parents dearly. Despite their (profound) financial mistakes, he is 100% driven and committed to caring for them for the rest of their lives. He wants them to move from MA to CA as soon as possible before they decline. \n\nAfter tons of research on living options—most of which they can’t afford, my husband believes the best option would be to build an ADU in our backyard for them to live in. As they decline, living in our backyard would be the safest, most humane option with our care. Also living in a brand new ADU is a lot more dignified than any other living option based on their finances. Despite concerns, I agree to it.\n\nImportantly, my husband wants his parents to pay for the ADU ($300K) which they will have upon selling their home. They won’t have much money left after that. His parents understand this and still love the idea. \n\nProblem: My husband’s sibling, who lives 15 miles from us, is blocking them from moving forward because the sibling won’t receive any inheritance with this plan. The sibling sees it as a “gift” to us. And the sibling thinks it’s unfair that in the future if we rent out the ADU (after parents pass), we’ll get income from it… so the sibling wants a portion of that income. There’s zero chance we will intermingle finances with the sibling. \n\nNever mind that we are committing to my husband’s parents’ care and allowing them to live their last years in a dignified way, near both their kids, and next to their only grandchild who they love so much.\n\nNever mind that the sibling has not made such commitment.\n\nNever mind that any other living option is out of reach, depressing, or even unsafe. \n\nNever mind that we will no longer have a backyard because the ADU will take up most of the space on our small plot of land.\n\nNever mind that we will live next to them and all their dysfunction (don’t we all have some dysfunction?) which we’ll have to see up close everyday. (i.e. his dad is a passionate conspiracy theorist; his mom is depressed and losing mobility; etc.)\n\nNever mind how this impacts me (who wants to live next to their in-laws?!) and our elementary school age child.  I am only agreeing to this because I love my husband and this is very important to him. Therefore, I am also committing to caring for them when that time comes. I haven’t even said this for my own parents!\n\nNever mind that with my husband’s parents in our backyard, we will be seeing his sibling a lot more. The sibling is the cause of a lot of conflict, whether in the sibling’s own work life, romantic life, and definitely within the family. My husband’s parents have trouble standing up to his sibling (their child) so this is what we’ll have to deal with. \n\nKeep in mind that his sibling has a lot of credit card debt and is continuously living beyond their means. His sibling was probably betting on inheritance to solve some of the financial problems. \n\nI would love to hear from others. I would be very grateful to hear other perspectives who understand this difficult chapter. Any way for us all to come to an understanding?"

We have lived together my entire life (I am 42), and we worked together for 20 years as well.  So I would see my mother practically every day of my entire life, and be with her from 8+ hours a day even as an adult due to working alongside her until only a couple years ago (she had to retire due to failing health).  Then I’d still see and talk to her at home as well of course.\n\nShe had a stroke in December however that left her paralyzed on one side and needs more care than I can give her alone in large part due to that, but is also having cognitive difficulties as well ever sense (before the stroke, she was Independent, just arthritis since her 20s limited her mobility in some ways, and other more minor challenges).\n\nTherapy did nothing due to her unable to really participate in anything close to actual rehabilitation (some range of motion therapies essentially, which hurt her more than anything else due to arthritis and other issues).  So, we had to get her into a Nursing Home via Medicaid as we are both low income, so I can’t really afford to stay home and give her 24/7 care on my own even if I wish I could (I am a son btw, which makes things a bit more awkward, but doesn’t really bother me overly much).\n\nI can’t stop thinking about my mom though, as before the stroke and LTC she already feared being Abandoned and can’t stand not being with her thinking that even in a short period of time she can come to believe I am doing so—due to cognitive difficulties and lack of awareness of time  passing normally.\n\nAlso, I just never really expected this to happen—especially not the way it did as I simply got a phone call from one of her friends that she had a stroke while visiting with them.  So, there has been no gradual acceptance of the inevitable if she had aged into the need for care.\n\nShe hates it there as well, as she can’t do much herself but thinks she can due to the Stroke causing Left Side Neglect and the cognitive effects as well.  So even when I visit, which is several times a week, we don’t really have the same relationship in some ways (less so when cognitive faculties lessen periodically).\n\nJust venting in a sense, but also… anyone have any suggestions for how to cope with it?  For myself or my mom?  Feel guilty, empty, and home is just not the same either."

Her husband passed away 12 years ago and they had no kids. She has no close family. A niece and a nephew, but she has little to no contact with them. She and I have been friends for almost 40 years. \n\nShe had a stroke in January. She had a couple of falls following the stroke and has been in a rehab facility for the past 30 days. I am not young and have my own health issues. But, now I find that I am her Power of Attorney (Durable, covers finances, medical decisions, and everything). I am currently awaiting a cardiac procedure. Last week, I had multiple conversations with the rehab facility because she fell, again. I drove 45 minutes to visit her 4 times last week. I received over a dozen phone calls from her every day. I am paying her bills, making her doctor's appointments, picking up her laundry and bringing her clean clothes.  \n\nHer Medicare runs out on Wednesday. If she stays at the place she is currently at, the fee will be $15K a month. As of Thursday morning, if I haven't found a new place for her to live, they will start charging her the private payer rate. She requires 24/7 care and her home is not suitable for live-in care. \n\nI called 7 different senior housing places, and no one has called me back. Not one single phone call. I have only a few days left and cannot get anyone to tell me if they even have an open bed.  I have to be out of town all day on Tuesday handling her banking and estate issues. That is going to be a 2 hour drive each way. So I can't make any progress on that day. In the meantime, she is slipping deeper and deeper into dementia and doesn't understand any of this. She just wants to go home. \n\nSorry to be such a Debbie Downer but I'm beyond frustrated. I love my friend, but this is a lot for me to handle.

      "story": "\nMy 80-year old father-in-law fell and broke his hip in early February. He was in a rehab facility and was recently discharged to enhanced assisted living based on his Medicare assessment. \n\nLimitations: He is unable to transfer himself from bed to his wheelchair and is unable to toilet or bathe himself. He does not know when he urinates or deficates. He has also been diagnosed with dementia and been deemed incompetent by two physicians, so we are his health care and financial POA. He lives in Michigan and we are 2.5 hours away in Chicago.  \n\nWe scrambled to find a place in the two short weeks Medicare gave us prior to discharging him from rehab. We visited 5 facilities and selected this one for their level of care, support and quality. All the places we looked at were expensive - this was at the higher end at $7,500 a month, with a $4k one time fee. \n\nPrior to moving him in, we coordinated a care plan for him with the facility - he needs help getting ready for bed, multiple times throughout the day with his incontinence, he needs help getting up and getting ready in the morning, taking his medication, going to meals, bathing, housekeeping, laundry, etc.  \n\nThursday afternoon move in was relatively easy. It was a big day getting him unpacked and all moved in. Around 6pm we noticed he was tired and sundowning a bit, slurring his words and asking what day it was repeatedly, so we left him around 6:30 pm.\n\nWe came to visit him the next day, Friday, about 1 o’clock in the afternoon, and we were horrified. He did not have any assistance getting ready for bed the night before, sometime overnight he had gotten up and changed his own diaper and thrown it away in his trash bin in his apartment, and there were feces on his sheets, comforter, pillowcase, and all over the bathroom sink, toilet and floor. \n\nWe immediately went to the care staff who assured us that this would be taken care of and would never happen again. \n\nThen we were putting it all together. If there were feces in the bed at 1pm, then no one had come in in the morning to give him his medication, no one brought him breakfast or escorted him to the dining room. \n\nAnd - again, it being 1 in the afternoon, we realized that no one come in to bring him lunch or escort him to the dining room. \n\nSo no one had checked in on him all day. \n\nWe feel so angry and betrayed. We thought that this was a nice facility, it received positive reviews and seemed perfect when we visited twice. \n\nAnd even after we had talked to the care team about all of this, no one came in to check on his incontinence in the 5 hours that we were there. \n\nWe are beyond sick over this and are second-guessing our decision. \n\nDoes he need skilled nursing? \nWas this just a big big mistake by the facility and they can actually provide the level of care he needs? \n\nWe are out of state, 2.5 hour drive away, so we can’t check on him daily. It sounds ridiculous, but do we need a nanny-cam? \n\nThank you in advance for your guidance and help. \n\n"

      "story": "TLDR: Younger sibling won't let me see my elderly mom alone. She is suspicious, may think I'm trying to impinge on her inheritance (though she's easily 10x more well-off than I). She disparages me to my mom, and won't let me walk through the house when I do visit (for fear I will look for documents?) I just really want to have a relationship with my mom like I used to, without oversight from my sister who is her full-time caretaker. I don't know what she is hiding if anything, she's just unreasonably paranoid and has cameras all over the house inside and out. I have to call before I can even visit. Do I have any recourse?  \n\n\n\\-------------------------------------  \nMy 87 year old mother has had cancer for several years now, but continues with chemotheraphy, and my adult sibling, is her primary caretaker so my mom can stay in her home. She has done a great job taking her to appointments, and following up with doctors. It's as much as I could ask since I live many states away and can only visit 3-4 times per year.\n\nHowever, my sibling is very paranoid of me and others. When my mom fell, and had a brain injury, she couldn't speak or walk. The doctors recommended my mom go into a temporary rehab facility care unit, but my sister refused. I was livid and we had a terrible argument because I wanted to follow the doctor's orders, but my sister (who is partially disabled) insisted she could take care of my mom. I didn't think this was feasible b/c if my mom fell, or had another incident, my sister could not lift her. Even though she has POA, I tolder her I too could hire an attorney (which I don't think I could, but I was angry and worried about my mom). We had never been close, but this was the incident that cleaved a huge chasm between my sibling and I.  \n  \nFortunately, my mom recovered and her brain is fully intact and she continues cancer treatments with 7-10 good days a month. For that, I am grateful.\n\nI'd always had POA, and was the executor, but when my mom fell, just before she became incapacitated, my mom transferred both to my sibling. I understood b/c my mom had bills to pay and properties to make payments on and my sister lived nearby and I'm in another state, so no big deal. Fine.\n\n  \nAfter I confronted my sister, six years ago (!), she has not let me be alone with my mother once. I think she thinks I want to usurp her authority, and take her inheritance. My sister is very well-off and married to an attorney, and I'm a middle manager. My mom and I were very close, and I have a copy of her 'old' will in which everything was spelled out (everything split evenly, etc.) But now I have NO idea of what my mom's wishes or plans are. I understand my sister could sell properties or transfer money even now without my or my mom's knowledge.\n\n  \nI have not spent 10 minutes alone with my mother, and my sister follows me around the house (and has cameras) everywhere. I think she thinks I'm going to root around for documents which is very unlike me. Once while visiting from out of town, my mom told me to come over around 3pm, but when I get there, she stopped me at the door and said, \"oh, you'd better leave, your sister isn't here!\" It seemed she was legitimately scared of my sister.\n\nI've asked my mom what her EOL plans are, and she's only said \"don't worry, you'll be taken care of...\" but no specifics, (which I kind of need to know before I retire).  Trust me, she's no millionaire, but has her house and a small rental property.\n\nIt bothers me that I hear my sister speak very ugly to my mom, and accuses me of being 'untrustworthy' to my mom. My mom says she needs proffesional help, but we're all in a complex and upsetting position.\n\nI live far away and cannot afford to hire someone to care for my mom in her home as is her wish.  \n  \nMy sister takes good care of my mom, but is very controlling and sometimes very negative and ugly towards her and bad-mouths me which I know really hurts my mom. Visits with my mom are very tense and often short because of the toxic energy coming from my sibling.\n\nMy mom can't say anything because she NEEDS my sister to care for her.\n\nDo I need to hire an attorney? I wouldn't care if my mom left my sister one of her two properties in exchange for the years of care, but I would like not to be kept in the dark.\n\nI miss having lunch alone with my mom without feeling like we're being 'supervised' ever minute. We talk on the phone daily (mostly about weather, and game shows). and I love her very much, but feel totally ostracized -- especially since we were estranged ruing my teens for almost a decade. \n\n  \n"

      "story": "A new policy that will increase SS benefits for a few million retirees will also render them ineligible for Medicaid as it will put them over the income limits. It has to do with govt. employees who took pension plans and got either very small or NO SS benefits. In an effort to rectify underpayment SS will give out lump sums and increase monthly benefits. While many see this as a godsend for others it is devastating and comes at the worst time. More bucks might sound great but it is likely to be lower in value than regular attendant services for those who get care in home. It's not enough of an increase to hire private help but it's enough to get you kicked off Medicaid. If you want to know if you'll be affected search for WEP / GPO retroactive payment. Sometimes a little help is too much.  "

She has rectal cancer, the treatment protocol is that she needs a surgery for a colostomy placement, followed by 6 weeks of chemo and radiation.  She is very sick, in pain, incontinent and really should be in a nursing home now.  She has been allowing “friends” aka addicts/people from her past to come live at her apartment in exchange for looking after her/keeping her company, which has basically turned into a safe haven for squatters.  She is being evicted as a result of this and is not to return to her apartment.  I have been working with her landlord to allow her to stay there until her colostomy surgery and then we will move all her stuff out before she is discharged. \n\nAfter the surgery, she will have no where to go and no one who is willing to take care of her or house her.  Our plan was to get the social worker involved and try to get her admitted into a nursing home as she would not have a safe discharge after surgery.  We casually brought this up with the nurse navigator today and she kind of started to throw a fit, saying that will never work because nursing homes will not accept chemo patients.  The question is now, ok, so what is she supposed to do? She cannot really do anything for herself and while there is a high probability she isn’t even strong enough for chemo, I just am trying to imagine every scenario and option.  Any insight is greatly appreciated! Thanks "

Complains about everything, and won’t go to the community center to meet anyone her own age (I pick up meals on wheels at the community center and know everyone, I wouldn’t just drop her off alone). I’m the only person she sees outside of doctors. She won’t even come to my house (next door to her) for Sunday dinner when my adult kids come home. Basically all she does is eat and watch tv - and she can do that in AL with people to bathe her and keep her safe. Of course I’ll visit often, but she’s already saying she wants me to continue to do her laundry and cut her hair. \n\nAll that said, I feel a lot of guilt. She doesn’t want to spend her money, live among strangers, and lose her pampered life and free servant. The AL has a nice one bedroom apartment, great food, has a fitness center with included PT, a podiatrist who visits (no more dremeling her toenails while she acts like I’m amputating her feet), a hair salon for haircuts, music programs a few times a month, game night, free snacks in the lobby, etc. and she’s already complaining about it all. What can I do to help her adjust, outside of taking her framed photos, her big TV and her personal items?\n\nSorry this is so long but this is my first experience with AL. Her apartment will be ready in two weeks after painting etc. and I’ve got to get a twin bed for her and have her doctor fill out paperwork to say what meds she takes and what her limitations are. I think her quality of life (and mine!) will be better there, especially if she makes some friends. But she acts like I’m sending her to the animal shelter. \n"

I have said it is like they are on the same road, but her husband is a car or two behind her (though he is **quickly** catching up.) The wife was put on the waiting list around mid- to end of January, and it was a fight even to get her on the list. The only thing that helped was that she has wandered in the past, which is higher risk. My FIL doesn't even qualify yet! He can't remember conversations from 5 minutes ago, looks in his closet and gets lost, etc. etc. etc. Forgets to eat, drink, bathe....\n\nThey live alone. And the truth of it is, they should have 24-hour supervision. MIL cannot be left alone for any length of time at all, and FIL....shouldn't be. We started with 12 hours a week to see where their needs are the highest. (The problem is they need reminders **constantly** throughout the day for **everything.** So, they need the help all the time.)  But also, they have both benefitted greatly from the companionship.  We are at $13,000 CAD a month (for both of my in-laws) and that is the LOW end of cost.  That price currently gives us 12 hours of supervised daytime care, and then we just hope they go to bed and sleep through, and have a good night. \n\nThe company we are working with is **amazing** and the care they provide is fantastic. They are kind, patient, caring, and my in-laws have actually begun bonding with them. The company is doing what they can to help us with pricing-- but at the end of the day, their workers deserve to be paid well and we totally understand that.  We just can’t afford it, and they absolutely deserve to be paid. Sadly, the cost just is not sustainable, and we need to even cut the hours during the day by at least half. This means there will be daytime hours of being unsupervised, which is terrifying. Unfortunately, where I live…sometimes an “emergency” has to occur to prioritize the patient needing the care to get them a space at a care home. (which is again, terrifying, but so sad--the system here is SO broken). We know my MIL cannot be left alone for any amount of time, (and her husband is getting to that point)... but this is what the system, where we live, essentially forces on families going through this. They basically have to live alone, get whatever care they can afford, and for the in-between, you almost have to hope for something to really fail so they can get into a subsidized bed faster. It's so broken and unfair.\n\nWhere we are, the waiting list for a subsidized bed in a long-term care facility, is 3+ years. If we want to pay for a \"private\" bed...we are looking at anywhere between $9,000-$13,000 CAD monthly for **one person**.  FIL hasn't qualified yet (which is mind blowing and terrifying), and so for him, it could be even longer. \n\nSo, like I said...living at home, using what private care we can afford....potentially waiting for something to fail...is our option.\n\nSo, finally after my novella.....TAXES.  Let's say we claim the $13,000 a month for care on their taxes....what would they \"get back\" when the taxes are processed? How does this work? When claiming \"medical expenses\"...how does it work, what do you get back, etc.? I am so clueless on this and could really use clear information. \n\nWe want to provide as much care as we can, but it has to be financially sustainable. Any ideas? Thoughts? Any guidance would be most appreciated. Again, we are in BC, Canada.\n\n  \nThank you!\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n"

The bank account has been in the negative for at least 4 months, and both my brother and I have emptied our savings to help them pay rent. \n\nMy mother is very immobile and needs care, which my father has been providing. She also hasn’t worked since the 80s and is very traditional minded, doesn’t want to divorce him “because they’ve been married for 40 years” and she still loves him. She’s no angel either, but she’s shown capacity for growth, change, and healing despite her age. \n\nWe were going to do a POA but my father is such a POS that he’s now no longer hiding his terrible choices, had abandoned any semblance of decency and refuses to pay us back or even pay normal bills. We think he’ll continue to do whatever he wants and will expect us to clean up his mess. \n\nAny money he gets he gives to them. We took away his computers, cell phones and even got him a dumb phone, but the scammers sent him money and he got a burner phone. Which he uses to talk to these people via Telegram and Signal. I’m in the process of filing a complaint via the FBI but I really am at a loss. My mom sent me screenshots that she was able to get of the conversations and he legitimately thinks these scammers are women he has a connection with, who also are promising him $150 million inheritance (??) and a cattle ranch. They’ve sent him card numbers to pay for medicine (not ours) and even cashier checks (that we stopped him from cashing). From the conversations I’ve read he’s doing tasks for these people but they’re also trying to  convince him to put his money in a different bank that she can’t access. My mom told me he blames her illness and wants sex from her (gross) and guilts her for not doing that with him, to the point where I think he’s trying to coerce her (fucking a). \n\nWe live in a VHCOL area and both my husband and I work full time and cannot take time off to care for her, nor do we have any room to house her, nor can we pay for in-home-care.

My brother is looking into IHHS for her so she doesn’t have to rely on him but she’s so codependent she still won’t consider divorce. And I think divorce is her best option, at least he will have to pay her alimony? \n\nFriends say I shouldn’t abandon them but, frankly, I want to. The only thing that’s stopping me is proximity and guilt. So, good people dealing with similar issues, what advice can you give? \n\nEdit: switched cars to card, her to him and some dashes for clarity. storyed on mobile with autocorrect undermining my writing "

      "story": "We need to sell my Mom's older sister's home to be able to pay for her care.  She's 94 and showing signs of some mental decline.  She relies on in home caregiver to help with food, meds, bathing and doctor appointments.   She lives in Baytown, Texas and owns her home in gated neighborhood. She receives $1550 /monthly for social security.  She will have approx $150K after sell of home. I don't think a reverse mortgage is viable but am open to feedback. Her health is fragile, but she's not suffering from any life-threatening scenarios.  I expect her to live to at least 100.  \n\nOur challenge is that she has threated to fight us (physically) if we try to move her.  She's been a pathological liar with a severe narcissistic personality disorder her entire life. She's toxic on many levels.  Her daughter and grandsons have disowned her.  My sweet Mom is her punching bag of mental, emotional abuse and has been for DECADES.  AND, she's the only one who will take care of her.  Thus it falls to me to protect my Mom as much as possible and be that logical, able bodied decision maker that takes actions.  I NEED HELP!!!!\n\nMy Aunt is very defiant and will not let us take control over any finances to help her.  We want ONLY to help, we don't want anything from her. We will not benefit in any way.  This is about loving someone unconditionally and doing right by her.  We have been telling her that her money will run out, but she feigns ignorance and won't make any changes - giving her caregiver $3000/month cash for the past 4 years (mainly for company since no one else can endure her venom).  Incredibly irresponsible, but we couldn't reason with her or get her to make a change to a more affordable option.   Her financial advisor has asked us to be present when he tells her  she's out of money (he knows she's difficult, defiant and delusional and will accuse him of stealing her money).\n\nReddit community, when she refused to sell the house, refuses to leave it (either for a small apartment or assisted living), what are my options, recourse?  \n\n\\* Do I try to get a social worker assigned to her? (mainly to witness her defiance).  \n\n\\* Do I have her legally declared mentally unfit/incompetent? -  how and by whom?\n\n\\* Is there an local/state/federal agency that will assist - where would I look?\n\n\\* Can someone provide ideas on how to communicate most effectively, non-threatening, non-intimidating, effective enough to get her to agree.  In addition, we'd need to get something legal in place since she'll retract any promise she makes. \n\n\\* I need power of attorney to help, but she will refuse.  But I must make this happen.  How??    HELP\n\n"

      "story": "My grandma is 97, living in the house she built 50 years ago, and her health is failing. Shes on oxygen most of the day, has lost most mobility, and a bad case of pink eye last year has left her mostly blind and she says she feels her eyesight get worse every two days. With this, she refuses to leave her home. She has told family members multiple times she just wants to die but her body keeps going. She’s still mentally sharp, and fully aware of the decisions she’s making. She has lived on her own since her husband passed in 1985, but now that she’s lost mobility and eyesight she’s extra miserable because she can’t entertain herself. Two years ago she was cleaning her own gutters, maintaining a whole yard garden, and playing computer card games. Her two adult daughters take turns being live in caregivers, but it’s too much for them, and she doesn’t want them there. She keeps terminating her hospice because she “can’t trust strangers in her house”, and will only accept a home health appointment when absolutely necessary. Any advice? My mom and her sister are on wits end, grandma is incredibly unhappy and uncomfortable all the time, and I think everyone is afraid of this continuing for several more years. "

Also , any suggestions for devices to test air quality? I just want to know . She does have an air purifier , but that’s just re-circulating the air .

She embraced it using it for Facebook, to read her emails, take photos of her garden, and speak to her relatives living in other countries via video chat. \n\nWhat happened however is it made me \"tech support\".  When I didn't live with her it meant regular calls on sometimes a weekly basis about something on her iPad that \"wasn't working\". She'd often forget her password or something would happen during an update. I eventually removed the password protection. Once I did indeed have to go into the Apple Store and get the iPad completely reset because she would try to fix things herself in settings and cause huge issues. \n\nLately, with the introduction of AI and other such services, there are features and settings that get added sometimes without the users knowledge. Or there could be some brief alert and I could see my mother accepting things and not understanding what she's accepting. Today she was extremely frustrated and upset with how her gmail was being filtered. After some poking around I found that she had smart services turned on which were putting her emails into Junk. Why? Because her pattern was to read the emails and then delete them. So it assumed they were all Junk. I turned it off. \n\nThis made my mother LIVID about why this is happening and who is going into her iPad and changing things and does that mean her banking app is not secure and who could she call at Google to complain and why doesn't the app look the way it used to. I tried to assure her that her banking was safe and not connect to gmail filters but she didn't understand and wants someone more qualified than me to \"fix it\". \n\nFor context, I have led large scale technology transformation projects for decades. I am retiring shortly but I am tech literate, have been immersed in the tech field my entire career. But to my mother \"someone needs to fix this\". \n\nI think this is about this particular generation who are used to going to a service counter or making a phone call and someone would fix things for them. This amorphous world we live in now where technology is in a cloud and software companies in one country service technology all over the world and there is no \"person\" to call who can magically revert your app back to how it looked in 2022 is so alien to them. \n\nTechnology is helpful in keeping them connected to the world but as a caregiver it is a huge source of conflict because she wants me to fix things for her and there's nothing to fix....

She was finally moved from her ICU room to a standard room, and then to a rehab facility where she currently is for a 3 week stay. \n\nAll things considered, she's been recovering fairly well. She's starting to get some movement back, she's doing well in therapy, she's more coherent than she was (still not as sharp as she was before), and she has finally been able to communicate through speaking with her trache cap.\n\nMy family has run into an issue. When my grandmother first woke up in the hospital (she was basically in a light coma for 13 days), she asked my mother where my grandfather was. My mom told her that he had passed away a little while ago. However, after her tracheostomy surgery, she seemed to have forgotten my mom told her that. \n\nOut of fear of my grandma becoming morose and not wanting to do her therapy, my mom lied to her and said \"oh, he's at home,\" when she asked again. It's not a total lie, his ashes are in an urn on a dresser in her home. But still, obviously that's not what my grandma was asking for. \n\nBecause of this half-truth, she has started to ask every couple days about him. At first it was easy to pretend like we couldn't understand what she was saying, but now that she has her trache cap on and can speak verbally, it's impossible. My mom told me not to tell her the truth, and to just wait until she gets home to break the news to her. Part of me understands, my grandma is very temperamental and might refuse her therapy if she found out. But the other part of me feels so heartbroken having to lie to her. \n\nToday, after her physical therapy, I went over and helped her eat lunch, and she looked at me and said, \"Is your PawPaw okay?\" And I told her he was. Then she looked so so sadly at her bed and said, \"I just haven't seen him at all...\" and I just kind of didn't say anything else about it. \n\nIt's killing me not being honest with her, it feels cruel. I wish my mom had just been up front with her again, instead of doing what she did. \n\nWhat's the right thing to do? Do I try to gently guide her into the truth that he's passed away, or do I just keep up the act until she gets home in a few weeks? She thankfully hasn't asked to talk to him on the phone or anything yet, but what do we do if she does? \n\nAny advice or insight would be helpful. "

      "title": "Pregnant and stressed out by MIL",
      "story": "I'm 5 months pregnant with our first child and stressed out by my MIL and her situation.\n\nShe is 55, has rheumatoid arthritis, and is on disability because of this. She currently lives with her mother in a house three hours away from us. Both of them are depressed and angry at each other all the time. They one-up each other on whose health is worse (my husband says this has been happening since he was a kid, even when they are perfectly fine) and are constantly trying wanting people to just take care of them.\n\nThis past year my husband's grandmother ended up in the hospital after a fall and becoming extremely disoriented. Turns out that she was diagnosed with diabetes and refuses to manage it. Like, she goes and gets the medication, has piles of it, and refuses to take it or manage what she eats. And my MIL says it's not her job to force her to do it.\n\nSo the grandmother ended up in a rehab place for a month and was doing everything she can to not leave because she wants to be taken care of. Even the rehab people said she needs to grow up and take care of herself because she is perfectly capable of doing it.\n\nSince then, my MIL has not changed her stance. We went and visited them before I found out I was pregnant and found the house in a disgusting state. My MIL collects cats and thinks it's normal for the house to be basically in a biohazard state because of it. (Not one surface did not have cat puke or feces, like even the windowsills, and there were kitten corpses in hidden areas). I was driving there every other weekend to clean their house and get it in a livable state until I found out I was pregnant. MIL refuses to get rid of the cats and gets mad at us when we tell her that we can't keep cleaning her house for her is she's going to enable it to be like that.\n\nWe recently found out that they didn't have hot water for months because when they called the water heater guy, he refused to come in because the room the water heater was at had been FILLED with cat feces. My husband drove down there and cleaned the room up, and realized that their pilot light had gone out and they never checked. 😑 \n\nHe saw the house was getting bad again. Asked his mother what is going on and her response was \"well I'm not going to be living here soon so I don't care.\" This concerned us and so we called his aunt and asked what his mother meant by that. His aunt told us that his mother is planning on moving in with us once the grandmother dies. We also found out that the grandmother has been clogging the toilet and instead of unclogging it for her, my MIL has said it's not her problem and got one of those hospital bed pans that she uses instead.\n\nWe are debating seeing if his grandmother needs to go into a home at this point because she refuses to take care of herself and is also falling for scams left and right. (Im an accountant and they both have refused multiple times any help from me on managing their finances) But I'm guessing that would be one of those Medicare homes since they don't have any money? Does anyone know where I could find this information?\n\nThe house they have would be a teardown/investor purchase at this point. But that leaves MIL on her own, and she says she can't afford the house on her own. MIL is assuming she is going to be moving in with us soon and keeps saying how much of a help she will be with the baby (nope, that's not happening). We expected her moving in at some point, but when she's like in her 70s. We can't handle a new baby and a MIL that wants to be taken care of and can be very toxic. So I guess our only other option is for her to go into a Medicare home as well? My husband also requested to go with her to her next Dr appointment so he can understand if there are actual medical things going on preventing her from taking care of herself, but MIL got angry and said he'll no.\n\nMy husband gets too angry to deal with this now because he said that he knows they are both very capable of taking care of themselves but they just refuse to, so now they are trying to get us to take care of everything."

      "story": "Life is a mess right now. My dad is my mom's primary caregiver, but he is currently in the hospital with serious medical problems and we just don't know if he will make a full recovery. As a result, we are watching my mom, who has early signs of dementia and is on a number of medications including insulin. She is fine with hygiene and mobile enough to get around the house by herself, but relies on us for medication, her insulin shots, and meals. It's tough for me to judge how much supervision she really needs aside from those tasks.\n\nIt's only been four weeks but keeping an eye on her is already taking a toll because we all work full time jobs and it's just hard to balance and coordinate everything. We were trying to take things day by day, but we're starting to fray at the edges, so the family has started to look into alternatives like home health care and possibly assisted living. After seeing some numbers, I just don't know how we're going to afford it. We are all firmly lower middle to middle class and don't have extra income to pay for this. \n\nThe problem is that we don't know exactly what their money situation is and how much they have saved if anything, and our dad isn't in the best shape to have this conversation. They do own their house free and clear and as far as I know they both get Social Security and he has a pension from his job, but that won't make much of a dent in the $5-7K+ a month quotes we're seeing for assisted living. If they sell the house and go into assisted living and then end up running out of money, what happens? \n\nHome health care seems like a better option, except it really depends on how much my dad bounces back after this. I think he was already struggling and they may need more help. At some point the cost of home care is going to exceed the cost of assisted living, I'd think.\n\nIf anyone has an advice or even anecdotes about how elder care worked out for them, I'd sure appreciate it because I am so worried about what happened to the point where it's starting to affect my health. Thanks.\n\nEdited to add: Thank you everyone for the thoughtful responses. Dad is slowly healing but making marked progress from when I storyed this. We are already in discussions with him about getting more care, because I think he needs to be involved in the process. Things are definitely looking up."

She had a stroke \\~7 years ago that left her with some physical disabilities and very mild cognitive issues.  Recently, she has quit taking care of her diabetes and has not been eating properly or seeing her doctors.  This culminated in an episode that landed her in the hospital for 4 days followed by skilled nursing.  She also has mental health challenges (borderline personality) which make this whole situation more complicated.\n\nThe care team at skilled nursing feels she is no longer safe to live alone.  She has not rebounded cognitively from the recent episode and they do not think she can handle medication, cooking, etc.  She is physically able to dress herself, etc.  They are discharging her next week.\n\nShe never would authorize a PoA because she said I would \"use it to put her away\".  She tells her nurses/social worker that she is going to move to assisted living near me, but then insists to me that she goes home to live alone.  I can't force her to go to assisted living, nor can I force her to accept an in-home caretaker.  She/I can't afford assisted living unless she sells her house, which I don't think she has the mental capacity to do.

I always start gentle, extra gentle if a person isn't feeling well, has a lot of tension or is just more physically sensitive, gradually massage deeper while paying attention to a person's body language and having them give me feedback so I know I'm helping and not hurting them but if his age for Parkinson's makes any difference I would like to be mindful of that and also if there are any tips or techniques you have for someone in those circumstances I would appreciate that.

      "story": "NY- Orange County\n\nThis is going to be a long one, sorry people but context is key IMO. There's a lot here so I am sorry if it's not put together in the best order or fashion. \n\n95yr old uncle that made me his power of attorney (full) and health care proxy. He was fine (walking and driving, the latter against my strong recommendation) until he took a fall at home last year which led to a pacemaker (heart issue caused the fall). While in rehab for the pacemaker he had a stoke which no one noticed for over a day, sent off to the hospital for a few weeks and then back at the same \"rehab\" facility. I say \"rehab\" as they would only do PT and OT for a short period a few times a week (AFAIK) and he quickly went downhill. Walking with a walker was a stretch by the time he was discharged. \n\nMonths go by and he is ready to discharge, not because he's better but because he's about to hit 100 days which is the most medicare will cover. Awesome system we have...\n\nI urge him to get into an assisted living facility and start and search for one in the general area that is decent. \n\nHe owns his home and has a roommate that was willing to help him in and out of bed/wheelchair, get his food, and generally be around. While this sounds good, he's (uncle) a hoarder and while he was in the rehab I went into his house for the first time (he always kept family out) and found it unsafe IMO (infestation, rotten food, just nasty). So, the roommate and I in the fall of '24 get a front room ready and make it as safe as we can (12yd dumpster for 1 room and the hall!). The one caveat is the bathroom is on the second floor, after a lot of back and forth and trying to get a closet converted to a half bath my uncle says he will use a commode, and a home health aide can come in to clean him no further discussion.\n\nBefore he leaves the rehab I speak with the director there to express my concerns with him going home and she offers to get APS involved (Adult Protective Services) to which I agree.\n\nI got him settled at his home, also picked up a monitoring device (Lively) to ensure he has quick help if needed. Things are not good but he's ok, eating, and alive. No PT or OT as he declined them, a few unpleasant discussions and he insisted he'd do the exercise himself (would not listen to reason).\n\nWe go on a visit to the assisted living facility that I felt was the best for him (he can afford it, at least for a year or two). The tour was nice, rooms were decent, residents seemed content and some happy. I had been to a few and this was the one that did not feel depressing and seemed more like a small community. No dice, he does not want to hear it. \n\nBrought him to his primary for a physical and told him everything, his hands were tied as well and he said that my uncle was mentally ok and just making bad decisions. \n\nAPS (called by the rehab) visited but never called me and said it was his choice to live that way (to the rehab director). So, I then try to get him a home health aide. That went south quickly as he frankly can be difficult if you are not of the same general race. Yep, he's a racist... Between his attitude and the state of the home (his room and hall leading to it are cleanish) the health aide company denied service and called APS. APS came again and said the same thing to him and the company that called. \n\nFast forward to this week, he's in a slow decline and does not eat much of what I bring him (I go twice a week, he's 1.5 hours away and wants nothing to do with any other family members). He fell out of bed and had a bowel movement on the floor in the process. His roommate cleaned up a bit but this is too much for him. Uncle denying any issues when I went yesterday to check on him and refuses to consider going to a facility, I called out the feces and related issues to which he downplayed it. \n\nHe's refused proper care from the beginning and continues to do so, he's dirty and I cannot get someone to come in a clean him (I cannot do it). I told his roommate to call 911 if he falls again (wish he did when it happened), at least that way he would get cleaned up and evaluated. \n\nIs there anything I can do besides calling APS directly and escalating until I get someone to help?\n\nI just want him in a safe place and not lying in his own filth, but he refuses.

I'm not trying to be provocative or gross, but I can't overstate how bad it has become. Some long time members of the group have stopped attending. I have talked to a staff member who assured me they are aware of the problem, but that he rejects all offers of assistance with personal hygiene. I am going to have a conversation with the administrator to advocate for getting him medical and mental health assistance.

While he is doing better from going and is less aggressive or irritated now that's he's medicated he is now sleepless and for the last few days has only slept for a total of five hours at night. He doesn't nap, nor does he seem to have any time awareness now, as he goes about the house doing chores and watching TV as if it is daytime. \n\nMy grandmother is worried he'll hurt himself and stays up all night with him refusing to sleep as long as he's awake. \n\nIt has been a week since he came back from the hospital and a little over 3 days since he's had a full night's sleep, what should I tell my grandmother to talk to his doctor about and what are some ways I can help to make things a little easier for his well-being?

      "title": "Giving up the life I built to take care of my dad? (Long)",
      "story": "Throwaway account, because I do feel shame over my feelings. \n\nI am an only child, 40F, with one living parent (88M). My mom passed away a few years ago and my dad, up until recently, had been living at his home by himself. I live a couple hours away, in a nearby city, where I have lived for over 20 years. My dad thankfully has had a great local support network of neighbors and friends and I visit weekly to help with groceries, prescriptions, etc. He was recently diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer but is getting hormone therapy and is doing well, all things considered. He’s responding well and has near-immaculate blood test results - and has no family history of heart disease or stroke. \n\nBack in November, my dad tripped and fell, breaking his hip. Thankfully he was hanging out with a friend, who called 911 then me. He ended up needing surgery and has been in rehab nursing care doing physical therapy. He is now set to be released in about two weeks but his therapists have flagged that he will need 24-hour care to help with meals, bathing, dressing, toileting, and medications. \n\nMy dad has repeatedly told the social workers, me, family, and friends that he intends to go home and that he doesn’t need help. I was able to get 480 hours of intermittent FMLA and since he wants to go home, I can try and work part time remotely while caring for him. Obviously that’s not a permanent solution. \n\nThings are complicated though. I LOVE my job. I have an extremely niche job where I run a research unit and am a subject matter expert. I have a pension with 18 years of contributions into it. I teach high level, technical graduate level classes at a nearby university and am frequently asked to give lectures and seminars. I have a boyfriend of 8 years - one who cannot move to his job and his aging mom. I have a crazy nice but expensive apartment. I run a book club. I have volunteer commitments. I have friends, I travel internationally, and I’m living my dream life. \n\nAnd… I will lose it all if I am needed to stay with my dad long term. I cannot do my job remotely beyond my FMLA. I am expected to teach in person. I cannot afford the apartment if I don’t have a job, and I cannot get a new one with health insurance if I need to care for my dad. He is very, very poor and would qualify for Medicaid if he applied for it. He’s opposed to living in a nursing home, even if I visited every Friday-Sunday and took him back to his house for the day. He wants to be at his house full time. \n\nI’ve explained the sacrifice I’d be making - I would be caring for him, unassisted, 24 hours a day without relief. I would lose my job, pension contributions, health insurance, apartment, and most likely my boyfriend, since he would have to commute 5 hours round trip on his single day off every week. I would lose my identity and my money. \n\nI love my dad - he is my only close family. But am I horrible for wanting to keep my life and have him get professional care? He keeps talking about finding someone who needs housing and having them live with him to care for him, rent free. That terrifies me - who’s to say this rando won’t rob and abuse him?! \n\nHalf the folks I talk to tell me it’s God’s calling to serve my father and care for him, that I can always find a job after he passes. Like we can life off his $1660/month Social Security and the $20k I pull from my IRA with penalties. The other half say that I should exercise my POA and just have my dad go into nursing care. But, my dad and I did that for my mom, and she spent the last year of her life hating us for the decision to take her away from home. \n\nUgh. I know I can’t be the only one who has been caught like this, between their family and their career/home/SO/identity/etc. but I feel so confused and alone. And scared. I will be doing this alone, either way when he gets sent home in less than two weeks. The question is, for how long? He can’t even walk, just stand for a few seconds at a time. His siblings have lived to be 90-98 so he could be around for a while. \n\nVent over. Thanks. TLDR: my dad wants to go home, I want him to go to nursing care so I don’t become unemployed, homeless, and single. "

She shoots down everything!\n\nMy mom, 85, has severe edema in both legs, to the point where she constantly has bleeding ulcers. The doctor said she's carrying 25 pounds of fluid. The only treatment she accepts is those air compression boots and wound care, and she complains that the wound care people don't know how to wrap bandages (she is a retired RN). She HAS to get her legs elevated but nothing works. \n\nHer caregiver is my dad, who is 87 and has his own health problems. He puts on the compression boots and dresses her ulcers. My sister also lives with them but mom snaps at her when she tries to help. I live 1500 miles away. \n\nAlso, based on family history, she could have to live with this another 10 years. She also has diabetic neuropathy and extremely bad arthritis in her feet. \n\nList of what she's rejected: \n- leg elevation pillow: Hurts her back. She also can't lift her legs onto it and neither can my dad.\n- inflatable elevation pillow: the models are skinny, so she's sure they won't support her. \n- just LYING DOWN for a while in the afternoon: She falls asleep and feels like she's wasted the day.\n- physical therapy: she had a good PT once, years ago, none of the rest of them have been helpful.\n- massage therapy: no. Why? IDK.\n- occupational therapist: No. She seemed open to the idea at first but decided she doesn't want any more therapists. \n- psychological therapy or counseling to help deal with her frustrations: Absolutely not, the whole healthcare system is against her. \n\nSo I guess I want to know, are there any clever ways to get her legs above her heart that I haven't thought of? Would a home health care worker know what to do? She spends all day in a recliner so her legs are a LITTLE elevated, but unless they're above your heart that doesn't help much. And are there massage therapists that specialize in this? How do I find them?\n\n(BTW, She's not totally inactive or isolated - she's remotely involved with running a free clinic and has a book club and friends, and we have monthly family Zoom calls.

She said that she was acting 'goofy' and was suffering from confusion, they are giving her antibiotics and that her white blood cell count was high.

I'm quite close with my grandmother and I had plans to come out in the summer to visit because I was scared this very thing would happen and I will miss my chance to see her.

I just want a realistic answer of what to expect and how serious a UTI at her age is.\n\n  \n\\*UPDATE\\*\n\n  \nI got an update and she has an infected galbladder with two stones so she is going into surgery today to essentially have it removed or at least the stones.

They agree and provide me a list of stuff to sell and the price he wants to get. I find a house to buy because the rentals all suck and make an offer and it is accepted.  I will buy the house, they will rent form me after we liquidate their stuff.  I will pay the mortgage until their sales are complete.

For 5 days it is sob, rage, sob, rage.\n\nThen it happens - when I got there last Friday mom asked me to unload the guns he has around the house because he is not acting rationally and ranging a lot.  I am not into getting shot over $50 and I agree so I unload his guns (5) and put them back.  After a particularly nasty completely irrational argument he comes in with a gun.  He wants to know who took his bullets.  I said \"I did because you are acting very aggressive and I fear for your safety and mine and moms.  He WILL NOT hear it.  Rails for an hour and a half. Says he will go get more bullets -or- another gun.  I say if that happens I am leaving and mom say she is going with me.  He kirks out worse and now on top of a constitutional right violator and thief I am a kidnapper.  Everyone goes to bed and I lock my door and put my bad and a chair in front of it.\n\nThe next morning he is somewhat normal.  He leaves unannounced in their van and we fear he is after a gun or ammo.  He comes back and he did not get more.  Then an hour later he abruptly comes in and says \"Are you giving my ammo back or am I going to get more?\" I say Im not giving it back.  He demands I call the sheriff deputies so they can tell me I have to give him is guns and ammo back.  I tell him that I already asked them (I did) and they said if we felt he was a threat to take them away and if they come and feel he is a threat to himself or others they will take him in for psych eval.\n\nHE insists so I call the sheriff so I did.  They come and sure enough they and EMS take him in for a 72 hour psych hold.  They transfer him to a geriatric facility and he calls us 5 times in 2 days berating my mom for putting him in, I am a thief, he has rights, he doesn't belong there, she did this on purpose to get him out of the way so she can take his stuff and sell it.  He is NOT moving up with me, doesn't want me around.  Well now I got a house for 2 people and he is out.  He is clearly losing his grip on reality and is in paranoia mode.  Has to be the onset of dementia or something.\n\nSaturday I take some clothes to him at the facility an hour away and while I am there giving some info to the NP they come out and say he has fallen in the bathroom an being taken to the ER where he still sits 2 days later being admitted.  They think they found a Pituitary macroandoma mass in his head - or it is false in the MRI because he kept moving.  Waiting for them to confirm or deny but with all the falls in the last year his head should glow it has been imaged so many times with nothing negative to report.\n\nSo I have a house I bought of them and close next Friday they won't be living in.  Mom is sick and tired of his reign of terror for 62 years and wants to go with me.  I have a house to sell, estate sale to schedule, my dad has lost his ability to think clearly and he refuses to go and wants to revoke my POA I didn't even know I had he signed in 1985 and made me executor of his estate in 2015.\n\nSince my mom was his unofficial guardian for the last 3 years, she has declined and cannot take care of him.  He cannot take care of himself and is evidently losing it I have a guardianship/conservator appointment with an attorney Tuesday.  I want to put him in a nursing facility/memory care whatever is appropriate near my sister, take my mom and get her settled up near me because she does not want him along anymore she is done.  Maybe if the mental health people can get him evened out form the rages and there is no mass in his head I can move him up near me too but not if I am a trigger.\n\nThe attorney says an emergency guardianship is as fast as 30 days.  I hope that is true but I doubt it.  It will give me the ability to liquidate this as were his wishes, find him a care facility and move mom."

      "story": "When Mom moved into assisted living they gave us the choice of me being responsible for supplying her meds and they'd \"try\" to let me know when they were running low, or them doing it. The only catch was that we'd have to transfer all her prescriptions to the local compounding pharmacy that they use, which also provides meds in per-dose packaging. We opted for them to supply the meds, both because that was easier for me and because having the meds in per-dose packaging makes it more likely that she gets her meds given correctly (in her first few days when we were using up meds we had brought from home, I witnessed staff getting confused about how many of which pill to give her).\n\nToday mom told me, \"<Pharmacy> finally delivered my meds today. I've been without them for a few days.\" Now I have to take this with a grain of salt because Mom is in the early stages of dementia, but she claims that she's gotten none of her prescription meds or her supplements for \"a few days\"  I can believe this because last year we had enough issues with them running out of her PRN migraine meds (OTC) and not being able to get the local pharmacy to send more over in a timely manner that I keep a spare bottle at home so I can run it over if needed.\n\nOther than complaining to them about her not being given her prescription meds as ordered, is there someone else I can/should complain to? This seems worse than running out of her headache meds.\n\n(And of course I've just moved her to a Medicare Part D plan based on the pharmacy the AL uses, so switching to something like Amazon Pill Packs may cost her more money, though we may need to do it.)\n\nUPDATE: I spoke to AL and they claim that she never missed any meds.  Given that mom has dementia, and is not a reliable reporter, I don't really know if anything happened or not."

      "story": "\nA week ago, my grandpa fell, hit his head, suffered a stroke, and now he’s way weaker than before, causing him to be sofa-ridden.\n\nHe can still kinda move. But he’s barely strong enough to adjust his position while sitting. He’s also somewhat strong enough to stand on his own if he has a cane, but he does not have the stability to keep standing and will fall over.\n\nHe has been wearing adult diapers ever since, but he complains that he cannot pee while sitting/lying down on the sofa, and can only pee (into the diaper) while standing up, or while sitting on the porta-potty.\n\nBecause of this, he needs someone to help him stand when he needs to pee, which is fine during the day. But at night, he still tries to stand up on his own to pee, which is extremely dangerous due to risk of falling.\n\nSo for the past week, I’ve been in charge of night duty from 12am to 7am, and I’m going crazy. Plus the fact that I’ll be starting my full time job this February and no one is willing to take over the night shift (naturally), I’m looking for a solution to this issue.\n\nIs there any reason for why he can’t pee (into his diaper) while sitting on the sofa, and can only do so while standing up or on the portable potty-potty? Is there any way to deal with this? \n\nI would love to hear what y’all think. Thank you.\n\nUPDATE + ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: \n1. He has not been able to go to the toilet since his stroke, as his legs have been too weak. So he’s sofa-ridden and wears diapers.\n\n2. He’s sometimes mentally unsound, especially when he’s half awake. In this state, he rarely responds, and even if he does, it’s incoherent.\n\n3. He’s gotten strong enough to stand and walk with a walker now. But because he’s still far too weak to stay stable (even with a walker), he can only shuffle a bit before losing strength. \n\nBecause of Points #2 and #3, we think he cannot stand up and walk while unsupervised, as the risk of falling is too high. \n\nSo we’re looking for methods to either:\n1. Help him stand up safely but prevent him from walking and wandering\n2. Prevent him from standing up on his own, but help him relieve himself without needing to stand"

      "title": "Very serious cleaning issues in a house where 3 relatives in their 70s are living together. Need suggestions on how to improve the situation.",
      "story": "My mother (early 70s) recently had my aunt and uncle (late 70s) move in with her after it was discovered they were living in hoarder like conditions. We thought it was primarily due to declining mobility and that it wouldn't be an issue once they were living with my mother. Most of their things were thrown away due to being destroyed by mice or put in a storage unit. However, in the 7 months they've lived with her, there have been several ongoing issues. \n\nThey won't shower or clean themselves. They frequently have accidents and will remain in soiled clothing for days. I helped my mom get a shower sliding seat thing that makes it easier to get into the shower and so they won't have to stand, but while they agreed it was a good idea, they haven't used it.'\n\nThey have 2 very old chihuahuas that they let go to the bathroom all over the floor and don't clean up after or take outside. The dogs are aggressive to everyone but them, although since they have no teeth and are so tiny, they aren't dangerous, but it makes it hard for anyone else to try to walk them. I put vinyl flooring over the hardwood floor in their bedroom to try to stop the damage, and my mom asked them to keep the dogs in their room, which they mostly do, but they sometimes let them out after my mom goes to bed. I bought pee pads for them, but they put them on the ground and just leave them there for weeks. Part of this is the mobility issues, but my mother got them a grabber to make it easier and a diaper pail for the pee pads, but they still only pick them up when greatly pressured. They strongly resist any sort of cleaning and will get belligerent towards family easily (but not outsiders, medical professionals, etc.). I suspect this is early dementia. \n\nThey leave clothing and towels with urine and feces, human and canine, in piles all over the floor in their room and in the bathroom closest to them. It is extremely difficult to get them to put these in a hamper, wash them, or even let someone else wash them. \n\nMy uncle clogs the toilet frequently (he seems to use too much toilet paper, I think partially due to mobility issues and being overweight to the point where he can't reach easily). He plunges the toilet almost daily, which is causing water and human waste to get all over the floor in the bathroom. He tends to deny this is happening, or will agree to clean it up, but then won't. I do think it's physically hard for him, but it's still a major issue. \n\nMy mother has back issues and arthritis, and while she was able to keep her house clean while living alone (with just the occasional help for repairs, big projects, annual maintenance, etc.) she isn't able to physically clean up after them as often as they are creating messes. She also has vision problems, and is mostly blind in one eye, which makes it harder to clean things that are not routine. Beyond that, it's upsetting to her to do more than the basics in cleaning up after them. She cooks for them, does all the dishes, goes on errands, etc. since she is the most mobile, and it stresses her out to have to keep badgering them to wash their clothes or clean up messes.\n\nMy mom's house smells so bad and the air quality is to the point that I can't enter it anymore without it triggering an asthma attack. The conditions can't be good for anyone. I'm also worried about my mom and her quality of life, because she used to invite people over and now she can't anymore. \n\nNo one involved has a lot of money, and my aunt and uncle live off social security and have Medicare. Is there a type of cleaning service that is affordable that could just handle the bathroom and their bedroom? It seems like normal cleaning services wouldn't work due to the biohazard issue. Is there a Medicare program, or some other way to get help? It seems like even if it could just be made a little better, then I could help my mom with the rest. They seem to cooperate much better with people they are not related to, since they have an attitude that my mom and I have to do what they say because we are relatives and younger than them and don't want us to make rules for them or tell them what to do.\n\n**tldr:** 3 elderly people living alone in a house with small dogs. Human and canine waste along with piles of clothes are all over the floor in one bedroom and a bathroom. 2 of the people haven't showered in at least 7 months and will wear soiled clothes due to accidents and refuse to change. Need help finding where to go for outside help, a cleaning service, anything. We're located in the southeastern US. "

He goes limp, can't talk, stares straight through you and is basically out of it for days. Also drools. It's been a living hell. He's been on 11 wards in 2024. He's been in hospital every month and discharged. They spoke to us about DNR not being an option. No one thought he would be here long. Not Dr's or hes family. We just couldn't work out what was going on. We thought dementia with lewy bodies or seizures. The hospital also thought those things or brain tumors but brain scans were not showing anything. It really seemed so much like strokes though. Anyway we finally have a diagnosis and even better there's medication. ADDISONS DISEASE!!!. We never imagined a recovery at this point but it's actually happened with the right meds, STEROIDS!. So I wanted this information leaving because we won't be alone. I feel we just got lucky, a paremedic suspected it. Now he's on the right steroids and doing great. He had been so weak he was bedbound for over a year. Luckily we're in a great area of the UK were we have had so much help. We could of never afforded the care he's had. "

Long story short: My biomom has pretty early onset dementia issues and is married to a man who seems focused on eating himself to an early grave. He's currently in the hospital for a stroke and an abscess in his neck and he currently was 517lbs.  My mother is 55, cannot drive, cannot remember basic history about myself or my little sister, and occasionally even refers to me as her own mother. \n\nShe's not a reliable narrator and I have been trying for the last year to get her to give my information to her doctors for clearance on what exactly her health issues are. My stepdad handles all of the finances and he purposefully hides what exactly their finances look like, and I'm honestly at my wits end at how to handle this. I know he's not officially retired but he's on some kind of leave from work, and he is cagey on his finances other than \"I am handling it, your mom will be ok\"\n\nI'm visiting in March and I really need a game plan of what I can do, but I also don't know what's realistic and feasible since I don't live in the same state-- and they're also adults. She's told me that \"her doctors\" are helping her get disability, but i literally have no idea who they are as she cannot remember anything. Stepdad is also useless for this as well, as he's handsoff on her medical care. There are no adults that live there that I'm related to that I can get concrete, accurate information about it, and the only other relative that can help me is my 21yo sister, whom I am currently putting through college/being HER adult.

How can I be part of the disability process for my mother without my stepdad getting access to that money? \n5.

She is also resistant to being bathed or fed.\n\nUp until about 8 months ago when we got married, my wife lived with Gma on and off from 2020, and would care for her before and after work (9-5) — feeding, bathing and changing diapers in the morning and evening.\n\nMy wife’s mother/my mother-in-law (MiL), despite being power of attorney and registered carer for grandma (and otherwise unemployed), claims she is “too stressed” or “too unwell” to take care of Gma, and limits her visits to 1-1.5hrs a day. When she is visits, we have seen her act impatient and aggressive to Gma (shouting, hushing), ignoring her vulnerable state, making Gma anxious.  \n\nMiL refuses to allow us to arrange a place in a nursing home with full time care for Gma because there is an ongoing legal dispute between her and her brother/Gma’s son over  who will have ownership of the house Gma lives in and has a life estate on. Her permanently vacating would have negative implications for MiL. \n\nInstead, MiL was initially open to moving Gma into her home in order to give her full time care. MiL withdrew money from Gma’s account to pay for furniture, repairs to her home to set up for Gma (in addition to withdrawing money to repair a swimming pool). \n\nGma was very happy to learn she would be moving in with MiL, as she doesn’t want to be alone (will spend entire days sitting out front of the house watching people walk by, or in the living room. However, because of Gma’s irregular sleep patterns she interrupts the sleep of MiL and her 28yo son (lives rent/bill free). Because of this “inconvenience”, after two weeks, her son demanded Gma be taken back to her home. \n\nFor months now, Gma has been living on her own. MiL will visit 5-6 days a week for a short time, but often during times Gma is asleep, which means she doesn’t get fed. My wife also visits as often as she can, usually weekends and early mornings to feed and change Gma’s diaper. The neighbours have expressed concern over Gma’s wellbeing, but MiL is adamant she won’t allow Gma to go into a home.\n\nOver the last few weeks, we have been contacting elder abuse support and geriatric support hotlines, and it seems are only solution is petitioning for a change of guardianship so we can override MiL’s desire to keep her at home. We are in the process of doing this, and have plenty of evidence supporting our case, but we’re worried about the length of time it may take given Gma’s fragility. \n\nToday, we received a call from police because Gma fell down and injured her head. We learned she was trying to get out of her house, because MiL unilaterally decided to have the locks changed to keep Gma locked inside. Gma tried to go out the back but tripped and fell, resulting in a visit to the Emergency Room with my wife (despite MiL’s reluctance). This isn’t the first time Gma has fallen and ended up in the hospital, and on every occasion MiL has not attended the hospital and instead my wife has. \n\nI am absolutely shocked and disgusted with MiL’s neglect for her own mother. My wife cares deeply for her Gma as she was practically raised by her, and ultimately we just want her to live the rest of her life with the care she deserves. \n\nTL;DR: My wife’s 94-year-old grandma (Gma) has advanced dementia, can’t care for herself, and lives alone despite her worsening condition. My mother-in-law (MiL), who is Gma’s registered carer and power of attorney, refuses to let her move into a nursing home due to a legal dispute over Gma’s house. MiL briefly moved Gma into her own home but sent her back after two weeks, citing inconvenience. Now, Gma is neglected, often unfed, and isolated. Today, she fell and injured her head while trying to escape the house because MiL had the locks changed.

      "story": "Father is on oxygen 24 hours/day. Also wears a CPAP at night. (Somewhat) recently got a hospital bed for his room, and put a tv in his bedroom. He can't wear his glasses and watch TV with his CPAP mask on, so I bought an oxygen line switcher (so he can use the nose cannula and wear glasses).\n\nWould rather not have him get out of bed to switch between cannula and CPAP mask (fall risk). What I need is an oxygen line holder/hanger that can attach to the bars on the side of his bed (near his head), so he can do it lying in bed. I'm thinking something like the thing you mount on a house to wrap garden hose. Figure it needs to come a foot or so above the bar so he can drape the oxygen line over it. Any ideas? \n\nDid several searches, but my keywords came up with next to nothing...\n\nHopefully the description makes sense ;) Thanks!"

Most of us have tried to talk to my grandma but she wont listen to any of us and basically is angry that we are not happy with how this family member is using her. My nan also isnt at 100% mentally with her dementia so she is easily manipulated. So far we are going through elders abuse and we are also taking her to the doctors in a few days to see if we can get a notice to say shes not 100% so i can become her power of attorney and tresspass the family members using her without my grandmas approval.

She’s grown quieter and a bit chubbier since she no longer enjoys moving around or participating in the activities offered at her senior care facility. It’s bittersweet because the grandma I grew up with loved tending her garden and making eggs that somehow tasted like magic.\n\n\n\nBefore we found her current facility, she was in a poorly run senior care home where the staff neglected her medication and wellbeing. My family was devastated, and we set out to find the best facility for her. What we discovered during our search was equally disheartening—an overwhelming lack of reliable resources. Websites like A Place for Mom bombarded us with calls, pushing facilities that were nowhere near the quality we were seeking. \n\n\n\nIt felt like no one truly had our best interests at heart.\n\n\n\nAfter that exhausting experience, I realized how much families like mine need a better solution.

Then there's the lack of Medicaid, with which his 12 hospital visits this year, existing debts and over utilization of his NH days, still isn't going to come his way b/c of his income ( the income vs. debt doesn't seem to matter?) \n\nFor the sake of my mother I'm here storying, she's very brave and giving and loving to have taken on my uncle's care and deserves a break. Hopefully someone has a resource they can point to for anything that could help, a non-profit ambulance service, advice on alternative routes to go on any of this (tried area on ageing and elder care attorney, to my knowledge both basically said he has to much income - which again is insane b/c he effectively doesn't), anything.

She’s a generous person. But she just can’t seem to understand how her overconsumption could be bad for any reason, including for her own well-being.\n\nFor every garbage bag of clothes we donate though, she seems to just keep bringing more in. The senior center she attends has a really cheap thrift store where she can get name brand, sometimes new, items for less than a dollar. When I try to push back on this gently she responds with how much she paid as if it matters to me…\n\nHer house is over a hundred years old and she already had mice before this issue had begun. The mice get into some of the old bureaus and nest in the piles of sweaters she stacks. I have tried so hard to talk to her about this and she is shocked whenever I mention mice. The stacks of clothes are also feeling like a hazard now that her mobility has been deteriorating. She has already fallen a few times and I worry that her walker is going to get caught on something.\n\nThere’s probably more I can share but maybe that’s enough to go on.

She gets angry if I serve her a plate, try to get her to drink water, take her medicines, take a shower, etc. \nThe worst part is that she yells at my kids when she thinks I can’t hear her and if I confront her about it, she gets so upset she starts cursing me out and has on 2 occasions tried to hit me. \nI am trying my absolute best to let it go and chalk it up to being irritable about not being independent anymore and possibly a side effect of her dementia. \n\nThere is nobody else in his family that is willing to take her in, due to her bad attitude, and she can’t afford to go into a home. We don’t want her in the state’s care either. Even with the aggression, I feel that it would be better for her to be surrounded by family. \n\nSitting and talking with her doesn’t really help because she forgets it all almost immediately. \n\nAre there any ways to help her reframe her perspective to be more positive and help get her out of this negative funk she’s stuck in?

Me and my wife are in between a move with the military so recently we started staying at her house (in Alabama) around 3 nights a week… and it is PUTRID. I’ll attach a video for proof but the house is utterly disgusting… when you want through the front door you can smell her rotten vagina, the 3 dogs she “cares for” piss and shit everywhere to the point the LVP floor is swollen full of piss in some spots. There’s a ridiculous amount of clutter throughout the house, rotten and molded food, dirt and debris. The entire house reeks of filth and we literally have to cover our noses to breathe until we make it to the room we’re staying in (which is spotless btw). I have tried countless times to deep clean the house only to leave for 3 days and come back to it completely disgusting again. Neither the grandma OR mother in law are conducting daily chores to help clean. \n\nMy mother in law has insisted that she doesn’t want to impose rules on her… she just wants to let her live the rest of her life how she wants… but never conducts clean up after. \n\nLast week me and my mother in law actually got in an argument because I over spoke and told her that I don’t enjoy it at her house because it’s so damn disgusting… she got upset and started deep cleaning… only her room though… which is still extremely cluttered with DUI materials that she never ends up using… oh and the concrete floor (because she never laid the LVP in her room) is stained brown from the dog shit and dirt tracked through the room…. It’s so bad. \n\nI have no idea what to do, do we confront her? Do we call APS? My wife agrees it’s disgusting but also admits she’d have very hard feelings towards me if I called APS… idk what to do but I feel so bad for both my grandma and mother in law. "

      "story": "Tldr: What kinds of general things can home health via Medicare help with for someone living in AL? Someone with extremely low mobility who can barely walk and has moderate dementia? Is there anything much they can do that can help with her general health and mobility that can help her last a little longer in AL before they say her needs exceed their abilities? FYI, she doesn't want PT. We have a doctor's appointment coming up to see if they will recommend home health via Medicare. We've had it before for a couple of things, nothing ever that useful. Want to talk to doc about general things it could help with, but feeling it may be pointless.\n\nMy MIL is in Assisted Living. She has moderate dementia and uses a rollator walker. At this point, she can barely really even walk with it, and can barely transfer up from the recliner she sits in all day into a wheelchair or into a car, either. Won't use a wheelchair on her own, and PT did work with her on that.\n\nShe has many joint problems throughout her body, including horribly bad knees and painful hammertoes on both feet. It looks like the hammertoes are the thing causing her the most trouble transferring now (at least that's what she says, the nurse at the facility says it's her knee - she has one that bends to the side like an elbow). She seems barely able to move one of her feet. None of this is operable per specialists due to her age and other risks. She's always refused to leave her room since going to AL so doesn't need to be able to get around the facility alone, but now she can barely get around the room.\n\nShe doesn't remember/believe that the podiatrist said they won't do surgery on those hammertoes due to various risks. The podiatrist suggested soaking her feet in epsom salt baths for the pain, I doubt this would help much, and she can't do it on her own regularly and the AL doesn't help with that sort of thing. Someone recommended to me that we look into home health to come into the AL to help with the soaks, and suggested that home health could help in lots of other ways regarding general health that would enable her to stay in the facility longer. I didn't really understand this; what can home health really do in this situation? If they could even do more showers, it would help - the facility does two a week.\n\nFYI, MIL has rejected physical therapy, and I do believe her when she says it hurts and doesn't help (I've got some joint issues too and this has been the case for me at times). The nurse at the facility said she may not be able to live there much longer, so the next stop is nursing. MIL will be devastated - she will hate having a small shared room in nursing, and we're trying to delay this as long as possible. She has no idea it's even a possibility, I'm sure.\n\nWe have an appointment to take MIL to the gp next week to talk about if they recommend and can order home health via Medicare (we've had to cancel the appt twice already due to her moods), and we don't know if there's a point going. She thinks we're going to talk about her foot, and we kind of are - but the gp can't do anything other than possibly order home health, which is what we're hoping for. But is there any chance home health will be useful at all here? MIL has been bitingly nasty about these appointments, and when we get there and tell the doctor what the podiatrist said, she won't believe it, and probably won't want home health (we can probably talk her into trying it, but it's going to be an emotional suck - it already is and has been). Is it worthwhile?\n\nAlso, is there a limit to how much help you get? Sometimes she has procedures and we need home health to help change bandages - though they only came once a week for a bandage that needed daily changing for weeks, so it wasn't much help at all."

She would wave away any mention of estate planning as something she’d get around to eventually. Her kids (my grandfather and troubled great aunt) were unwilling to push her on it and were intimidated by the upfront cost of hiring estate attorneys. So she was fully in her 90s with barely a napkin with her wishes on it. She ended up going from totally fine to dead in around 6 months after a flu that turned into pneumonia that eventually resisted antibiotics until it killed her. By the time the family realized she was going to pass, it was *far* too late to start the talks on her estate. \n\nWhen she died, she had *nothing* planned. She left a gigantic property with a small farmhouse in a state with incredibly high property taxes. The troubled great aunt immediately looted the small farmhouse and changed the locks so no one could get in. She allowed her addict kids to move their trailers onto the land and also their herd of goats. My grandfather was so devastated by the loss of his mother that he didn’t even try to fight it, and because there was no will in place, it was a he said she said of “[Great Gram] wanted my kids to live here and she said you could have [other piece of the property].” \n\nCut to over a decade of fighting in court to evict the trailer kids, sorting out who got what and parsing the land out to be sold. In that time, property taxes in the tens of thousands needed to be paid each year and repairs needed to be made to the farmhouse when it was repeatedly damaged by storms. It ultimately took almost 100k (mostly from the grandkids who didn’t have that kind of money to blow) and irreparably damaged the relationship between troubled great aunt and my grandfather to get the estate figured out, and about 90% of it could have been totally avoided if there had been a will in place. \n\nIf your elderly relative waves you off about estate planning or has “concepts of a plan” or “an attorney they’d like to call soon”, do *not* stop pushing, even if they get pissy about it. Push them until they get it done. "

      "story": "My aunt is 91 and lives alone. My 74 year old mom is her primary caregiver. She stops in to check on her several times a day, runs all of her errands - grocery store, pharmacy, doctor appointments, etc. and provides her meals. I help out several times a week as well with meals, visits and errands. We’re essentially the only family she has. It’s become overwhelming over the past few years as her needs have grown but we’ve managed - until now. 3 days after Christmas she had a fall that caused a small brain bleed (6mm thick subdural hematoma). The hospital kept her overnight for observation but basically said she was ok. They put her on a short course of anti-seizure meds and discharged her. She blamed the fall on a sticky wheel on her walker so we got her a new one. Other than a little weakness she seemed ok. But yesterday morning I went over and when I went in, I found her lying on the floor unconscious. I managed to wake her up and called the EMS. The hospital ran new CT scans and said the hematoma had grown to 9mm thick but had stopped bleeding again. We have no idea if the bleed had started up again on its own and that’s what caused the fall or if the fall caused the bleed to restart. At any rate, they kept her last night and likely tonight but we’re not sure what to do once they release her. At this point she needs full-time care and we simply can’t provide that. We are talking to the hospital social worker later today but have no idea what to expect as far as options go. As most elderly are, she’s adamant that she’d rather risk living at home alone than go into a care facility but she’s also making it clear that she expects my mom or me to stay with her from here on out. Again, just not possible. What options should we expect from the social worker? Is short-term 24/7 home health even an option these days (a few weeks until she regains some strength at least) or is a long-term facility the only option?"

It's gotten to the point that almost twice a day she's giving out her information to people who pretend to be her boyfriend on Facebook messenger. \n\nI think the root cause of this is loneliness; she doesn't meet people on a daily basis who have had similar life experiences and so she feels very alone and feels the need to meet strangers on the internet. \n\n I work at a nursing home and know how important it is for people in her situation to maintain their dignity and to find community with other people. I have tried explaining to her that she could live in a retirement community, for example, and she might be able to meet someone that she could potentially consider companionship with/ remarry. I explained that I see it all the time at the nursing home, and that there are similar places that are not nursing homes. She just has such a strong bias against nursing homes, understandably; is there a way to convince her of these options?\n\nAre there other things for seniors? Things that she wouldn't need to live at or be committed to, but places where she could frequently attend and meet similar people at?

We are in Louisiana if that helps. \n\n  \nHe can no longer live on his own, and no one in the family can stay home and take care of him. On his most recent trip to the hospital, I inquired with the social worker about a nursing home, but they said a nursing home won't accept a patient on chemotherapy as they have to pay for it. Not sure why that is an issue because we bring him to a separate hospital for that. \n\n  \nWhat resources can I reach out to for some type of care / assistance for my father? \n\nI am sadly in 1 bedroom apartment so I cannot have him move in with me and my family, with the small kids the floor will be more of a trip hazard than anything. He is staying with his sister but she works full time as well. "

      "story": "My friend is in her late 70s, has previously battled breast cancer and just discovered skin cancer on her nose.  She has been taking care of her sister who is in her 80's that now has Alzheimer's and cannot really do much on her own.  My friend purchased a condo for her sister to stay and pays the mortgage (still in her name), and visits her place multiple times a day to deliver groceries, cook and help her with whatever she needs.  She also pays for a cna to stop by twice per day to help her shower.\n\nMy friend made it clear that she could never let her sister live with her as they never had the best relationship and the Alzheimer's just makes it more frustrating.  Now with my friend's medical issues and constant frustration - plus depleting finances, she feels like she can't do it anymore.  Her sister is constantly calling her to come over even when its not necessary.  For example, her sister claimed she was constantly peeing herself and changes her diaper 8 times an hour - leaving a mess for my friend and unnecessary money spent.\n\n  \nUnfortunately, the sister does not qualify for Medicaid because she makes $100 over the poverty line in north Carolina ($1400/month) between her pension and social security.  The sister has a daughter but she lives in California and is battling her own cancer and does not want to deal with her mother and does not have any money to send over.  The condo is my friend's savings for her future needs so she cannot sell it to invest in her sister's nursing home because then she would have nothing left for herself.\n\n  \nMy friend's mental health is really deteriorating, but she feels like she has no options besides just selling her condo and leaving her sister on the street (which of course she cannot do).  \n\n  \nTLDR: She resents her sister for not saving for retirement but at the same time feels like she is the only one willing to do anything for her, but her physical and mental health cannot handle it anymore.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I’d love your opinion on what resonates more with you or your family if you had to choose a care home (or an assisted living facility) for your loved ones. \n\n\tOption 1 (Holistic/Wellness/Tech approach):\n- They get access to VR sessions (nature experiences, simple immersive games), light therapy, aromatherapy, and gentle massages.\n- They can drink custom herbal infusions and use certain natural supplements that (allegedly) boost well-being.\n- The environment is designed like a mini spa, with soft lighting, color therapy corners, and so on. It’s all about “mind-body balance” and a bit more modern or “2.0.”\n- The focus here would be to improve the physical and cognitive abilities of the guests, increasing the degree of autonomy.\n- from 83€ to 90€ daily (5% to 10% higher in the area)\n\n\tOption 2 (Traditional cozy approach):\n- More of a “homey” environment where seniors do activities like baking cookies, knitting, small group dances, or board games.\n- The focus is on creating a family-like atmosphere with volunteers or staff leading typical recreational stuff.\n- Basically, a warm, comfortable but beautiful place reminiscent of home, not so much fancy VR or advanced wellness interventions.\n- about 75€ daily (average area price)\n\n\tIf you were in charge of choosing for you, your grandma, grandpa, or any elderly relative who’s still quite independent, which one of these two approaches would you prefer, and why the does it appeal to you? Or maybe you’d want a blend of both? Any feedback is priceless. Let me know what you think about the costs vs. benefits as well. Thanks a ton in advance!"

Basically, what do you do about an older relative that stresses themselves out about Christmas?\n\nI have an older relative who gets so stressed about Christmas. She is on a fixed income that hasn’t really kept up with the cost of inflation, so the past couple years have been a tighter and tighter squeeze for her even though she lives fairly frugally. She stresses a lot about Christmas - specifically gift giving for her large family. It’s important to her that everyone (kids and adults) receive something from her. Over the past few years, the increase in family members and the tighter pinch of inflation have really started to stretch her thin. The gifts last year were mostly just…sad. The consumables were either unlabeled mystery chocolates from who even knows where or items bought on super clearance that had been expired for a couple months. Everything else was from the dollar store or Ollie’s and was, for lack of a better word, junk. \n\nNormally I wouldn’t care what people do with their money but it kills me to watch her do this every year. Every year it’s the same cycle: around September she starts getting major ants in her pants about affording Christmas gifts. Myself and the others adults my age will say some  assemblage of “we don’t need gifts we just want to see you and the kids want to see you”. This falls on deaf ears. She will then spend the next months scrimping and saving to afford the present stockpile, getting gradually more stressed about whether she’s doing enough. She will give the gifts to her relatives, and we will open them and smile and thank her. Then once she’s gone we will throw away the expired snacks/candy and pile the rest up for donation. It’s just a giant waste. \n\nIs there anything I can do to ask her to stop without being cruel or hurtful? So far the gentle approach of “don’t bring us anything we just want to see you” has been totally ignored, like she’s convinced we are just saying that to be polite. “The kids have plenty of toys ~~and they don’t need a vat of bright blue dollar store slime~~.” is also a non starter. \n\nAnything you’ve got would be appreciated!"

She uses a walker for mobility, and is incontinent, using Depends, but is otherwise quite healthy. The same lady coming 3 days per week helps bathe her and change her bed, clean her room, etc. Meals on Wheels comes 5 days per week and brings lunch and weekend foods, and the helper grocery shops, and sometimes we do, so they are well fed and the house is stocked. When the helper is not there, they can usually do pretty well for themselves, considering, and we live a few blocks away and she calls us quite frequently for help when they are home alone.\n\nWe installed 3 cameras in their home a few years back, so we can check on them when she doesn’t answer the phone, or when she’s gone to a doctors appointment and her mother is left alone, etc. She calls us periodically and asks us to check the cameras to see where she put something she has lost, etc, so they are both VERY AWARE the cameras are there. It is no secret and it’s for their safety.\n\nNow, to today. Her mother has been complaining about an earache so they made a doctor’s appointment for her today and the doctor prescribed some ear drops for her.  The pharmacy delivers their medication, so it came this afternoon. MIL tried to get the cap off the ear drops but was having difficulty because of the weakness in her left hand from the previous strokes, so she called my husband to come and assist. He told her he would be there in a little bit. Usually, if you give her some time, she can do whatever she wants to, so I clicked on the camera in the living room/kitchen area so I could see if she was getting it open or still struggling.\n\nThis whole scenario below unfolded as soon as I started watching:\n\nMIL: Now, mama, I’m gonna give you some Tylenol but don’t you touch the damn bottle, do you hear me? If you need Tylenol, you let me know and I’ll give it to you, do you hear me?\n\nGMA: Yeeeeaaaaahhhhh…… (in a meek voice)\n\nA few minutes passes and she finally got the top off the ear drops bottle. She walks over to GMA….\n\nMIL: Why did you push your walker right in front of me? When I move something out of the way, you don’t touch the son-of-a-bitch again, you hear me? Don’t touch it. (proceeds to shove her walker 3-4 feet away from her)\n\nGMA: (just watching, didn’t say a word)\n\nMIL: Lean over so I can put these drops in your ear.\n\nGMA: Oh, you got it open?\n\nMIL: Yeah, mama, I told you I did, now lean over!  Lean your head over, mama!\n\nGMA: (tilts her head about 1/2 way down)\n\nMIL: That’s not enough, mama! Lean your head all the way down. Dammit, Linda, what the fuck is wrong with you lately? You don’t do a fucking thing right. (Screaming at her, and proceeds to take her good hand and shove GMA’s head toward the table multiple times, very roughy) Now, hold still!\n\nGMA: (never speaks a word, leaves her head on the table)\n\nMIL: (puts the drops in her ear, still fussing at her mother the whole time.)\n\n(I didn’t hear exactly what was said here because I was furious and had gotten up to go find my husband and show him. When I got to him, GMA was up and walking back to her room. To my knowledge, she never responded to her daughter at all.)\n\nAt this point, I was hoping the camera had recorded it so I could show my husband but he told me when you view it live, it doesn’t record. Ugh.\n\nI told my husband that I’m pretty sure this is elder abuse (coming from another elder, no less) and that GMA didn’t deserve to live like this. We knew she’s always pretty short with her and fusses at her a lot,  but that’s the first time I’ve seen her cuss her like a dog and put her hands on her physically. She’s told us her mama is a bitch to her and doesn’t love her, but we’ve never seen a stitch of evidence of that. Ever. She always talks to us about how good her daughter is to her, and how grateful she is to live there.  I would never treat my mother this way or she’d probably back hand me at 92 years old and I would deserve it if I did!\n\nHubby listened to me and just responded that the only option is to send GMA to a nursing home and he knows she doesn’t want to go there. She likes being able to get up, wander through the house, get something to snack on when she wants, she has her own room and big screen TV, just doing her own thing. He didn’t say much else. I told him I was going to ask GMA tomorrow if she wanted to go to a nursing home. I’m debating about telling her what I saw on camera. Maybe I should confront MIL about what I witnessed as well, but it will cause an uproar in the family, right at Christmas, and it will be a dang mess. I don’t even know if hubby would want me to say anything to his mother, but personally, I think HE needs to speak with her about it.\n\nIt just makes me wonder now what all does go on that we don’t see. The cameras record every few minutes or so, when we’re not watching it live, and it’s possible some issues may have been recorded, but unless we know when to look for it, it’s like a needle in a haystack with hundreds of video snippets every hour.\n\nI don’t know how to approach this. I feel confident it doesn’t need to be swept under the rug. How much worse can this get? I’d like to get some feedback on this dilemma. Thanks for reading this novel. It’s 3 am and this is bothering me bad, everybody’s asleep but me, so I needed to get it off my chest for tonight.\n"

She falls regularly but refuses to get a life alert because there is a charge for the monitoring.  She refuses a lot of care for my father because of money.  There is plenty of money to take care of their needs, but to listen to her, they are on their last dime.  My mother is completely frustrated with my father’s condition and treats him abhorrently, constantly yelling at him for not doing something or not being able to make up his mind, and berating him.  He is also pretty much completely deaf, and will not wear his hearing aids.  I think they are very old and complicated and I am sure, outdated, but my mother won’t let me get him new ones because she just claims he won’t wear them.  His not hearing anything other than her yelling at him does nothing for his inclusion in anything going on around him.  I took them to lunch a few days ago while I was visiting and my father asked me if he could kill her.  He was making a joke, but…Today she wouldn’t give him a Tylenol Or Advil after a minor dermatologist procedure because he has “a very high pain tolerance.”  \n\nI have Durable Power of Attorney for my father, but she is still primarily in charge of him, although I believe it is affecting his health and well-being. They live two states away from me, and I was contacted today by their caregiver, (who only works two hours a day, four days a week because of ‘money’) and was told she had just been contacted by Adult Protective Services, about my mother’s treatment of my father.\n\nThey are in independent living in a facility and awaiting an apartment in the assisted living department of their facility.  My mother refuses to let my father go into Memory Care because it will “cost too much”.  I do have a sister who lives very close to them, but she is in denial about my father’s condition, and doesn’t spend much quality time with them.

I have to host Thanksgiving - at his house because he has mobility challenges, which is a lot harder than doing it at your own house. I have to host Xmas - at his house, same thing. Relatives insisted they wanted to visit him, so now I have to cook and clean for a fancy lunch at his place tomorrow. I have to do the Xmas shopping and wrapping and all the prep and put up his tree, and of course he wants Xmas cookies too. My brother has medical conditions and is unemployed, so there is a lot of expectation there that I financially support them and provide other benefits. My sister tries to help, but she has to have a major surgery next week and there's no one else to take care of her. So I have to step up there too.\n\n  \nIn the meantime, my dad keeps falling prey to salesmen. First it was one of those \"let me inspect your roof for storm damage.\" Now its major changes to his phones and communication tools. Both of which end up on my shoulders to fix when it goes wrong because he's 88 and doesn't think so clearly anymore. I hate those sleazy salesmen with the fiery hot passion of a thousand suns.\n\n  \nI'm tired and frustrated and burned out and resentful. I miss having a life. I miss being able to meet a friend for a cup of coffee or go on vacation. I miss feeling like my own life mattered. I hate feeling resentful. I keep trying to be in the moment, knowing dad won't be here forever. I keep trying to focus on giving him the best life possible.

So please know that I see you. I see how much you are doing for others. I see how much you are giving up in your own life to give them a good life.

We know how hard you work and how much you do, and how you are holding the family and the world together for you LO.\n\n\n\nSo, for all of us tired, resentful, still-trying caretakers, bless you.

She also has extensive history of being victim to abuse - physical, emotional, sexual. \n\nCurrently she works full time but experiences extreme amounts of pain with working and I’m concerned she may face termination whenever her employer find just the right time. They don’t like her much but she’s been with the company for 20+ years. She has many physical problems - prediabetes, overweight, struggles with falling over, osteoarthritis, multiple disc bulges in lumbar spine. 25-50% spondylitic anterolisthesis (basically vertebra in spine has slipped forward) as well as foraminal stenosis (spinal condition that compresses spinal nerves), some type of foot / ankle injury in addition to plantar fasciitis.

I have a sibling who’s done a lot over the last several years and they are at their breaking point. We need to determine next steps that provide her with a good quality of life but that support her.

Struggles to clean up after herself, wash laundry, daily chore tasks. A huge pro though is that she takes her medication daily for the most part. \n\nShe doesn’t seem to care to do anything, although she enjoys certain things she doesn’t want to make friends, learn / do a hobby, socialize, exercise.

Last year, I visited her and (with her permission and full cooperation), we got her affairs in order while she was still “with it.” Financial and medical POA. Will. Funeral arrangements. Copies of her various accounts, debts, deeds, etc. I went down the list from various elder care websites for what I needed to collect. \n\nAt first I let things go back to normal. No need to step in yet. She’s only 70; I thought we had plenty of time. Well, her bank account showed up when I logged into my online banking (we have the same bank and I was added to her account). I ignored it, but a couple months in I noticed her account was in the negative. I looked at her account. I was shocked. She goes into the negative multiple times a month, racking up overdraft fees. I called her; I thought her account had been hacked. There were so many Amazon and Temu purchases. No, she admitted she has had a spending problem her whole life. \n\nThings got worse from there. She asked me for help, so I tried. I tracked expenses. Suggested she slow down on spending. Told her to slow down on spending. Laid out her spending categories to her. Got into screaming matches. Went through periods of not talking. Last, she told me to butt out of her business and we haven’t talked in 7 months. \n\nThe investment company that manages her retirement account (that she’s also draining quickly) has called multiple times to see if I’ll intervene. They say she will run out of money by end of next year. \n\nI don’t want to get back into the boxing ring again, especially right before Christmas. I have the time to help her with her finances now but I don’t have the time in the summer. My job is all consuming in the summer, and I don’t even have time to balance my own checkbook let alone my mother’s. It’s my dream job, and I won’t leave it. We’ve had an enmeshed dynamic my whole life; I really don’t want to get caught up in it anymore. \n\nPeople have suggested I let her fall on her face—she’s her own adult and all that, but I am an only child to a single mother. There is no one else. When she runs out of money, she will turn to me. She has turned to me for small amounts of money here and there over the years. I don’t have money to give for caregiving. She actually (pathetically) has more income from social security and pensions than I do from working, which adds to my resentment over her spending. I don’t have a room to give her in my house, and that would absolutely ruin my marriage. We don’t have money for a retirement home. She has given no thought to the cost of hospice or end of life care. \n\nI guess I’m ranting, but I mostly I need to know when is the big blow up fight worth it? Do I do it now to hopefully stretch out her retirement account for another 5 years maybe, but she’ll still die in the poor house? She’s only 70!"

      "story": "Hi, I'd like to get some of your feedback on \"Life Alert\" systems for seniors. \n\n  \nMy dad is in his early 80s. He is spry and relatively independent, though he has some minor issues with balance, mobility, etcetera. He is becoming more active (walking a mile or so daily and working around the house). He loves to go to our family cabin up in the mountains. It's off a state highway, about an hour from the closest hospital. And public safety services are far away, save for a Forest Service work center down the road. \n\n  \nHis former primary care provider recommended he get a Life Alert system, especially when he spends time alone at our cabin. I have been wanting to find an excellent system to help him in case he has an emergency up in the woods. What recommendations would you have on this? Thank you!"

My 91 yo mom is incapable of managing on her own so I’m taking care of her right now and driving her back and forth from the hospital. Today I’ll start packing a suitcase for my dad to take with him to a rehab facility where he will stay for several weeks. I will probably put my mom on a flight to stay with my brother in a few days. I toured facilities yesterday for my dad and picked out a few to tell the social worker today. I’m fried. I hope I’m doing right by my parents."

      "title": "Elder Isolation",
      "story": "Hi everyone! Warning: This is long. Sorry.\n\nWondering if anyone has suggestions for my situation. My mother was diagnosed dementia in 2022. At the time, my older sister and her two adult children were living with my mom. My mom owns her home. No one's name is on the mortgage but hers. She did give my sister a general power of attorney to help her manage paying bills. This is because my mom doesn't drive, and she wanted to be able to send my sister to her bank as needed. Now, I have never seen this POA, but I did speak with my mom about it before her diagnosis and that is how she explained it to me. So, my sister can pay HOA fees, bank, etc. Immediately after my mom was diagnosed my sister wanted to put her in a facility but we (my younger brother and I) didn't feel that was the best option due to knowing my mom's wishes about her care. However, we offered to help. I, having been a caregiver for 20 years, already know how difficult this journey can be. I stayed opened to hearing what my sister needed or wanted and have been offering to help. Knowing my sister has a mental health condition that she refuses to take medication for (her choice and I supported her on that always), I recommended that we create a plan where my brother and I can take turns helping with appointments or just giving my sister a few days off by taking my mother with us. She Immediately became combative when I offered this suggestion. My brother's son offered to also help out but she refused his help. Yelled and screamed at him to a point he will no longer try to contact my mom or come see her. \n\nAbout 6 months into my mom's diagnosis, I was listening to my sister talk about how hard everything was and I reminded her I am here to help. I work from home, I can be there at any point to assist. I told her it is okay to ask for help. She told me she didn't need help and became very belligerent to the point I got up to walk away and leave, she followed me around not letting me leave. She cornered me in my mom's room and my mom was standing at the door and she pushes the door on my mom. I told her my mom was there and she kept doing it. This hurt my mom. I don't know if it was more her feelings or physically but I did check to see if she bruised and she was fine. My sister's behavior escalated until she spit on me. At this I told her she had just assaulted me and mother, to which she said she didn't care. Her son pulled her away from me, and I took my chance to leave. My first mistake happened here because my husband wanted me to press charges. I did file a report but I told them I didn't want to press charges, I just wanted an officer to talk to her about what she had done. I should have pressed charges and I was so upset about what she had done to me, I didn't even think to report what she had done to my mom beforehand. \n\nAfter that she started refusing to allow me and my brother to see my mom. Every time we go over there she threatens us, won't open the door, and we have to call for a wellness check to get them to help us see my mom for all of 5 mins. It's an hour drive over there which isn't a lot but it is tough on me because I have my own mobility issues and family to care for. In January this year, I filed my first Adult Protective Services report because I had called for a wellness check twice at that point, my sister doesn't return calls or respond to messages, and she was presenting the same behavior every time we went to visit. They closed the case, and of course they don't give you any feedback or let you know anything. I reported her again a month ago because my mom had called tell me her arm was broken and ask why I hadn't come to visit. I asked her how her arm got broken and she said she fell outside. She had broken her arms years ago and I thought it was the dementia because I kept asking when and she would hesitate and then just say, \"Oh, you know.\" After I hung up with my mom, 5 mins later my sister calls to tell me it happened 2 weeks prior. So, yes, she was listening to our phone call. When I asked her why she didn't tell me earlier, she says because I wouldn't have helped anyway, to which I told her I cannot help you unless you tell me what help you need and then allow me to give that help. I told her we need to get to a point where we can sit down and have a conversation to make a plan on what kind of help is needed. She then starts yelling and screaming at me on the phone, calling me the devil and all sorts of other things. My husband was standing there listening to her, and her son , who was home with her, had to take the phone from her to get her to stop.\n\nI went to see my mom that weekend and noticed she had a really nasty swelling in one leg and nearly black foot. I asked my sister if it happened when she fell and she didn't answer me. She let me stay 5 minutes and any time after that she has repeatedly done the same behavior of not letting me in and threatening me when I show up. So, I filed again with APS and the case manager called me and asked me what was my problem with my sister, and I explained everything but then he made it sound like this was simply a family dispute. I don't know what she told him but it doesn't give me much hope. When he called me that day, he even told me my mom was in a nursing home for physical therapy and had been for weeks and would be there a few more. He gave me the information so I could go see her, and the next day after I saw her, my sister pulled her out of the nursing home and took her back home.\n\nNow, for Thanksgiving I texted my sister and told her I would be coming by to see my mom for a few hours and I told her a week in advance. She didn't respond and luckily I thought to bring a friend with me to just witness the behavior. I didn't give her too much info on what I had been dealing with only that sometimes she will let me see my mom and sometimes she won't. No surprise, same reaction. My friend had me call for a welfare check, cops suggested my sister be on psych hold but they couldn't do it themselves because when they got there she didn't display the behavior we had witnessed. It was like night and day how she acted when they got there like she had not just been yelling and cursing up a storm. And she again told the police I was harassing her, no one wanted me there because I always caused drama when she was the only one being belligerent. The cops did not ask anyone else in the house anything. My sister stood in the door and didn't let anyone else come to the door, but I did get to see my mom. She was crying and shaken and even told the cops she got dressed up because she knew I was coming and she was sad because my sister wouldn't let me in.\n\nOutside of reporting her for isolating my mom from us to APS, I have consulted a lawyer about guardianship and I cannot afford it, so I would have to file on my own. I'm currently in school full-time, working full-time, and a family caregiver for my husband. I think pursuing a psych hold makes sense, I'm just afraid if she can manipulate them into believing nothing is wrong, it will only escalate to make things worse for my mom because I don't know how she's treating her when we're not there and based on how she is treating us, we are very worried. But I am very disappointed with APS, the process, and how they've been handling things because things are only getting worse not better. I gave them the number to talk to my husband, my brother, and my nephew on both reports and they all say they've never been contacted. And this is the 2nd report! Which will prove that this isn't a me vs my sister situation that they're making it out to be. I'm just frustrated and not sure what to do next or how to do it.\n\nAnyone have to pursue guardianship without a laywer? If so, any tips?\n\nAnyone deal with a family member like this with a mental health concern who is responsible for someone's care? How do, or did you, navigate that situation?\n\nIf you're in Arizona, any suggestions for how to get myself a case worker to help manage this situation with APS and my sister?\n\nAny and all opinions, suggestions, or referrals are welcome.

She has been placed in a nursing facility for her remaining time on this Earth, and the facility isn’t the best. My uncle and cousin don’t have tons of money to provide private care, so options are limited. I want to get a nanny cam for them to place in her room to keep an eye on her at night. I am trying to find something that doesn’t require WiFi. Is this possible? Everything I have found online requires an SD card, so my uncle would not be able to watch her in “real time”. I’m not very tech savvy, but I was really hoping there might be a way. I’m afraid that using a cam that requires WiFi would alert the workers that there is a nannycam in her room. "

      "title": "Need Advice re: Dad with Dementia",
      "story": "Hi, my dad was diagnosed with dementia 3 months ago. I live in PA, and he lives in CT with his wife of 3 years (they've been together about 7 years). He and his wife are 78 years old.\n\nDad's wife, me, and my husband made the decision to move him into memory care in CT, his dementia progressed very quickly. It took over a month and a half to get him placed there. But due to his physical limitations, the facility called the day he moved in and said he was not appropriate for them due to mobility problems like almost falling and falling, even with a walker. We had a nurse from a facility that provides only memory care come evaluate him, but they said he was not appropriate for their facility either. And we contacted skilled nursing facilities that said he could be admitted there, but he would still need a one-on-one aide due to wandering and mobility problems.\n\nAfter that, we moved dad back to the home he shares with his wife and hired in-home aides. Two aides per day, each with a 12-hour shift. It's only been a month and a half since my dad moved back into the house, and his wife is struggling greatly with feeling overwhelmed (even with the aides there) and spending time over the holidays with her adult children and her grandchildren (one adult child lives 15 minutes from them, one lives 7 hours from them).\n\nSince late September, I have traveled to their house 4 times to help out and do what I can. I still work so going there every week is just not possible (the drive can take nearly 6 hours each way with weekend traffic). My dad's wife wanted me to come for Thanksgiving, but my husband can't get days off easily as a law enforcement officer. So her daughter canceled her plans to go to Florida and went to my dad and her mom's for Thanksgiving. I visited last weekend instead of on the holiday. Now my dad's wife wants me to come for Christmas so she can go visit her son for a few days. I would have to go alone, my husband can't go, and I wouldn't bring my 19 year old with me. I told dad's wife I understood she didn't want my dad alone with an aide on Christmas, and neither did I, but he won't know it's Christmas on December 25th. I suggested my son and I visit a few days before, celebrate Christmas, then she go visit her son and grandsons. \n\nSorry this is so long. My question for you all is, should dad's wife and I be comfortable leaving my dad with his aides (who are great and who he recognizes) on a holiday? I feel like he could be like this for years and I can't spend half of the holidays away from my own family (including my mother, who had no family other than me, my husband, and our son). For those of you living far from your loved one who has dementia, how do you handle being helpful while still living your own life? I'm wondering if dad's wife may want me to take over and move him close to me, but that is such an awkward conversation to have. Any thoughts are very much appreciated."

      "title": "Grandma giving all her money to new husband/pastor. Help. ",
      "story": "Advanced apologies if there are gaps or anything seems nonsensical as I am livid. \n\nSo, my grandfather was the sole provider. He died in 2012. My dad was an only child. He took his own life in 2016. I am an only child. My dad was living in their old house since my grandma moved to an apartment after my grandpas passing. My parents divorced in 2012 as well. I have been living in my grandparents old house since my dad’s passing. It has been paid off and established in a trust that now has my grandma, myself, and my uncle (her brother) on it (something about needing 3 parties). Basically I took my dad’s place. In addition to that she made me her power of attorney and put me on her credit union account. \n\nMy parent’s divorce was hard for me. The loss of my grandpa and dad have been very hard for me, and especially very hard for my grandmother. We have always been pretty close but a certain kind of close. I love her dearly but can’t fully be myself around her. This has made keeping as close more difficult as an adult, especially since she has kind of tried to replace my dad with me. \n\nShe found a lot of solace in her church community. And for that I am thankful. But church has never been for me, and especially hers. I have never been able to stomach her pastor. It is a Wesleyan (some weird form of Baptist) for context if it matters. \n\nHer pastor had a wife and family, the only one that I know of. In 2019/20 (can’t exactly remember) his wife got sick. My grandma did a lot to help take care of her. She died within the year. \n\nLess than a year later I had suspicions her and her pastor were “dating”. Months later she sprung it on me that they were engaged to be married. I was shocked and very very not happy. Wondering why legal marriage was needed even if they just wanted to enjoy each other’s company. Or just have a spiritual ceremony. (I really wanted her to not have anything to do with him but also cant’t/ don’t want to control her life. Don’t want her to be lonely. Don’t want my decades of suspicions about this guy to be true). They wanted to travel and share a bed, and in their religion there is not separation of church and state basically is what I was told. They are in their late 70s and based on their health I’m guessing and hoping that sharing a bed is literally just that. \n\nI was told that her moving into his home would mean she is no longer having to pay $700+ in rent. He is not in debt. She would not have to pay anything. The trust wouldn’t be chanced for my/our house and same for his house going to his kids. No idea where life insurance stands at this point. \n\nFast forward 2-3 years- \n\nI see on her account every month checks written to him for $1-2k. Every month. Anytime a house or vehicle expense comes up she pays it. Just in the last few months an extra $1500 for a porch renovation. $600 for tree service. $500 to get his van repaired (she still has her car as well). This is in addition to what I call his “allowance”. She has also in several occasions written him LARGE checks for $5k, $10k, and now last week I have just seen $15k. Her checking account now has only about $3k in it. \n\nShe does get over $2k per month in social security. She also has investments in stocks/bonds. They were not wealthy by any means but my grandfather was smart, hardworking, very frugal, and certainly not expecting to pass before age 65, and I’ll venture to guess not expecting all his investment to go to the guy who read the Bible to him on his death bed. He never went to that church but gave religion a go after battling cancer for so many years, as many do. The pastor was simply doing his job and my grandma thinks he was truly saving his soul as she brings it up like he did something out of his way or miraculous. \n\nThis is so long and I’m sorry but the story is long. Basically it really seems like she is being manipulated and/or taken advantage of. I’m afraid I can’t convince her to stop. I’m wondering what legal rights I have or action I can take if any at all. I have the name of the senior advisor at the credit union. I have the name of the lawyer/ elder law group the house trust is in. I’m okay with giving some money/ sharing expenses with her husband even if I hate the guy (would make story much longer but maybe can elaborate in comments) but these amounts are insane. I’m afraid he is setting his kids up with her money. I’m afraid my house is somehow going to get taken from me. My finance and I are planning on moving soon because we are expecting and it’s a one bedroom. The money is supposed to go to me from the sale, and I’d be fine with my grandma keeping some… but for HER and any care SHE may need and not to get weaseled from her into his account. \n\nThis is also obviously a big point of awkward contention in the family so I have been avoiding the issue admittedly but I simply cannot anymore and don’t know what to do, especially without any knowledge of legal back up. I don’t know if I should talk to her, the bank, or the lawyer first. Probably her but the stress of that is killing me. Especially since he is so manipulative and will know even if I speak to her privately. "

      "title": "Grandmother with declining health, being manipulated and endangered by her stay-at-home son (my uncle)",
      "story": "Hi all - Hope all is well!\n\nI am currently witnessing an interesting time in my family, and am very concerned about the wellbeing of my 84 year old grandmother. I would love any insight, advice, prior experience, or just a friendly ear to vent to. \n\nMy grandmother has COPD, is recovering from lung cancer chemo and surgery, is on full-time oxygen, requires a walker to get from one room to another, is having bathroom accidents, and is showing clear signs of dementia.\n\nShe currently lives in her family home that she has lived in for the past 50+ years. \n\nHer son (now 50 years old) moved into the house 15 years ago after a divorce, and has been living there rent free for all 15 years. Prior to my grandmother getting sick, she cleaned the house, cooked all of his meals, paid for all of his groceries, did his laundry, etc. \n\nFor the past year now, my grandmother’s memory has been completely shot (forgets what day it is, forgets names of relatives and close friends, forgets plans and events, etc) and after her cancer surgeries, has a very hard time getting around and can barely use stairs, and spends most of her day sitting on her couch watching TV. She also is on multiple medications that are meant to be taken multiple times daily. \n\nRecently, my uncle began showing signs of some form of mental illness (I don’t believe in diagnosing people as I am not a physician) but he seems to have clear symptoms of mania, bipolar, and schizophrenia. \n\nHe was recently fired from his long-time job for trying to fight his boss after being confronted about sitting on a chair outside of his building during working hours, and tanning instead of doing his job (he has had multiple issues at his job over the past fee years, and I believe this was his last strike) When confronted, he got in his boss’s face and said he “deserved respect” and that he knew “everyone was plotting against him.” (this information was obtained by a town official that I inquired with as I was suspicious as to why every time I visited my grandmother during a weekday, my uncle seemingly was always home)\n\nSince being fired 3 months ago, he has referred to himself as being “retired” and has stopped paying child support to his ex wife. He also had his son removed from his health insurance, and told his ex wife to “reach out to his ex employer to figure it out, as he wasn’t handling it”\n\nHe spends every day smoking marijuana in my grandmothers basement, blasting music, and created fake “tasks” to do around the house (ie- ripping up perfectly fine carpets, pulling out shrubbery and bushes (which have ruined the landscaping of my grandmother’s home), and throwing out perfectly fine furniture items). He also randomly screams to himself for hours on end, pretending to be speaking or arguing with someone.\n\nLately he has also gotten very aggressive with my grandmother, screaming at her, threatening her, and manipulating her thoughts about multiple family members with delusional stories. \n\nHe refuses to go grocery shopping for himself or for her, refuses to clean the house, and constantly fails to give her the daily medications she needs. My mother, her siblings, and the grandchildren have all chipped in to do weekly grocery trips, constant checkins, and ensure she’s taking her medicine - however this is not feasible for long term as if she misses enough of her medication (that she frequently forgets to take, she wont be around much longer) and in the hours when nobody is there besides my uncle, anything could be happening behind closed doors\n\nHe has also begun creating these false and delusional situations, wherein he thinks the house and himself are being targeted by felons, and has gotten rid of all spare keys, constantly locks the entrance doors to the house, and is very skeptical whenever my grandmother has visitors (including family members). \n\nAs he refuses to clean the house (will not do dishes in the sink, refuses to run the dishwasher, has never touched a vacuum or mop, etc) we hired a housekeeper to help keep things clean. The last time she tried to come on a scheduled day, my uncle locked her out and told her not to come back, as he stated he didnt trust her and that “her services were no longer needed as his sisters would clean the house instead.”\n\nRecently, my grandmother left the house and I took to visit a relative, and he promptly left to go out to a bar, locked the house doors knowing my grandmother was out and would be returning, and removed my grandmother’s spare house keys from their usual hiding spot. She was left outside in the cold rain while I had to wait for my mother (his sister) to bring a key and let us into the house, because he claimed he was “too busy to come let us in” - as he was 5 minutes away, out at a local bar.\n\nAs she can no longer drive, he recently sold her car without consulting with her or any of his siblings (my mother and his 2 other sisters) and pocketed the money for himself. \n\nWhen confronted about this or any other of his irregular actions, he immediately reacts with anger, violent screaming, throwing things, and threats, then claiming he is going to call the police on his sisters for “harassing” him. \n\nAs it has become extremely evident my grandmother can no longer live alone (and living with my uncle is at best, not having a positive impact on her quality of life) we have started the process of discussing selling her home, and finding alternative options for her to live. This has resulted in my uncle going into more manic episodes, as I believe he knows his 15 year free ride is potentially coming to an end.\n\nHe has since started trying to convince my grandmother that family members are out to get her and that she needs to safeguard her home and money, and can’t trust anyone.\n\nHis latest absurd act was convincing my grandmother to withdraw $30,000 from her annuity fund, and write a check in that amount to him so he could “work on making the house better for her” - he did not consult with anyone else in the family prior to this, and in a normal state of mind my grandmother would never in a million years do such a thing. \n\nHe has also been using her credit and debit cards to fund his day to day (along with his newly found $30K) and has made it clear that her house is “his house” and he will be staying there.\n\nSome additional facts below:\n\n- My mother (my grandmother’s oldest daughter) is the executor of her will.\n\n- My grandmother is not “of sound mind” but has no medical diagnosis for dementia or anything memory related\n\n- My grandmother is the sole owner of the home, and my uncle has no legal documentation claiming any type of ownership (i also don’t think he knows anything about squatters rights or whatever that is) \n\n- My grandmother’s last will and testament states that upon her death, the house and all the funds and all of her savings etc, will be split evenly between all of her children (but in the meantime she needs her money to be able to support herself and any future medical needs)\n\n\nI guess my question here is - what the hell can I do to save the wellbeing of my grandmother? \n\n- Can she be diagnosed with something that will allow my mother to become her POA, to give atleast some sore of safeguard to stop my uncle from convincing her to take more money out of her annuity and investment accounts and gifting them to my uncle? \n\n- Can anything be done to get her in-home medical care without the possibility of my uncle turning them away or locking them out of the house due to his delusions? So she can be given medicine, food, bathroom help, etc on a normal cadence?\n\n- If we decide we would like to sell the house, and our uncle has a manic episode (without physically threatening or hurting someone) and refuses to leave, what can we do to get him the hell out? \n\n- When confronted with authority or people outside of the immediate family, he typically puts on a “nice guy” act, and is very good at convincing my grandmother and others that she is totally safe and fine in her current state and that he is looking out for her\n\nPlease feel free to sound off with any thoughts, opinions, experiences, etc.\n\nI just feel like I am going crazy watching my grandmother decline day by day, when she could have such a better quality of life, while her son refuses to feed her, give her medicine, lives in her house rent free, screams at her and manipulates her, and genuinely puts her health at risk. \n\nThank you all in advance, I greatly appreciate it, as well as my entire family "

      "story": "Hello,\n\nGrandma is 84 y/o, American and living in Florida. One daughter is living(?) but estranged, currently living alone, no spouse/partner.\n\nHer grandchildren have been attempting to stave off the inevitable (moving her to a nursing home), but that seems to no longer be an option. We attempted in-home care with visiting nurses, live-in family, etc. and over the past 12 ish months she has fired / kicked out all of them. I think the count is 3 professional agency home nurses and 3 family/friends (the most recent being paid rather than a live-in free rent situation). \n\nShe has grown increasingly nasty, aggressive, and uncooperative. And that's in addition to her memory, continence issues, sentience, etc. further degrading. All despite her insisting she is fine and living independently (bills, grocery shopping, etc.) despite that not being the case.\n\nSo...it's time.\n\nI (eldest grand child, 37 years old), live across the country and travel a lot due to active duty military service. I am also the executor of her will, medical POA, etc.\n\nThe other grand children (27-36) live adjacent to her (one is a brilliant and successful nurse who has gone utterly above and beyond over the years taking care of our grandma).\n\n**Questions:**\n\n**1) Finding a NH:** Any recommendations on how to quickly find and vet? Other than a google search, we aren't really sure where to start\n\n**2) Transitioning Gma to the NH:** it's increasingly clear that gma will not willingly go, and will need to be forcibly removed from her home and/or tricked (i.e. \"let's go to lunch\" and we take her to the NH unbeknownst to her). Any recommendations?\n\n**3) NH Costs / Financing:** She has some cash squirreled away (that we manage, not her), so she would likely be able to afford decent living for several years. But is any of this covered via Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc. I believe she gets a partial SS benefit from her late (first) husband who was active duty for a few years a long time ago. I mention this only because I remember her saying she got a SS paycheck boost (not much) when he died 10 years ago. Not other major life insurance, investments, etc. that we are aware of. \n\n**4) Medical POA:** Like I said, I am her medical POA, but have no idea what I'm doing here. I am aware of the need to call the laywer's officer that drafted her documents, but can anyone provide any guidance as to what this entails, next steps, how to properly \"deploy\" this power, etc?\n\n**5) Reverse Mortgage:** She placed her home into a R Mortgage about 10-15 years ago. So, what happens when she moves out to the NH? Is it abruptly taken by the bank since she would no longer reside there? Or is that only upon her death? \n\n**Thank you all for your time and attention.**"

      "title": "Feeling super lost about what to do with my father.",
      "story": "(Oregon)My father has truly slid downhill since my mother died four years ago. He is 69 but he looks 90, half his old body weight, can barely get around. He is not treating his diabetes the way he should be and for that reason he is unable to get a necessary surgery on his back and shoulder that would relieve his aggravating pain. He cannot clean up after himself very well because of it, or cook for himself often.\n\nHe's also making bad choices due to mental decline. He has lost upwards of 50k to scammers using apps like cashapp and paypal. He fundamentally doesn't understand how to keep his information safe, he trusts every email and text he gets. His bank is constantly freezing his accounts due to fraudulent acitivity, which has caused him to miss a mortgage payment. He is also now on some $20 a month phone plan using a flip phone because he couldn't afford a regular phone. Not sure where his smart phone is \n\nHis cognitive health is on the decline as well. Alzheimers runs in our family, and he is starting to show signs. He loses time a lot, forgets he has appointments, and is apparently showing up hours late to places he was supposed to be because he gets lost or forgets where he needs to go. He tries to hide this from me and lashes out at anyone who brings it up. And this is on top of severe anxiety and probably depression. He has called me to complain about having to care for the family dog while calling his name outside, but I adopted that family dog two years earlier because he was neglecting him and the dog was next to me the entire time.\n\nHe's also turned pretty confrontational and angry since my mother's death. He has alienated a lot of family and has made himself unwelcome in many family spaces, which has limited how much help I can ask for from his family. Hard to ask someone for help with someone who cussed them out on Christmas last year.\n\nAnd if all that wasn't enough.... it seems like he is on some illegal drugs. He was waking up disoriented and unsure where he was, thinking my mom was still alive and it messed with him bad. So he started to try to find ways to stay awake. He met a horrible woman in his town who introduced him to cocaine to help him stay awake. He ended up having an episode after staying awake for 3 days where he had some sort of break from reality and forgot that certain loved ones had died 15 years ago. He had to be hospitalized overnight and they said it was just sleep depravation.\n\nBecause of the cocaine, he failed a drug test at his doctor took him off his pain medication. My dad has real, demonstrable, crippling pain. Being taken off his meds cold turkey like that, even though it was his fault, was devastating. He has admitted to me that he is buying them off the street.\n\nHe was staying with my aunt yesterday and he dropped his stash and a glass straw with cocaine residue so she kicked him out. She called and now we know it's finally time to force him into help.\n\nI live across the country and my dad and i have a very contentious relationship, we have never gotten along even in the \"Good Times\". It's gotten to the point where his sister thinks that he needs to be put under a conservatorship and forced into assisted living, if necessary.\n\nI just have no idea where to even begin. I am living paycheck to paycheck and recovering from cancer treatment, and my partner is about to enter the police academy. I have been advised to contact elder law offices in my dad's state and to look into medicaid-financed assisted living facilities. But i don't know how I would pay for the lawyer or what to ask, I don't know how to get his medical and financial records to prove his decline as part of my conservatorship case. I have also been advised to call Adult Protective Services but I am worried they will find something illegal in his residence and report him to the authorities instead of getting him help.\n\nAnd i don't know what kind of responsibilities I would have if i did become his conservator. It's all incredibly overwhelming.\n\nHas anyone dealt with anything like this? What do I do first? What CAN i do from a completely different state? How do I tell my dad that i want to get this conservatorship over him? I dont think its safe to be driving, I dont think he is fit to control his own finances and if he goes into a home, he won't be able to own his firearms anymore and i know that will be a huge deal for him.\n\nI'm sorry for the vent story along with the request for advice. I'm at my wit's end and both scared for my father as well as furious with him for letting himself get so bad and doing literally nothing to stop it. Every bad choice he could have made, he has and now I am in this position.\n\nAny guidance would help, any push in the right direction or words of advice would be much appreciated. "

About 2 years ago, she lived alone in a condo in San Diego that was close to her sister and they would have social gatherings once a week. Since her diagnosis in March of last year, she has become less mobile, relies on a walker and is unable to drive on her own. We moved her up to be closer to us in Reno, NV. She briefly lived with me and my husband (long, dramatic story) and got an apartment of her own that is halfway between me and my younger sister. \n\nThe reason I am storying is because my mom's social circle is my sister and her kids, my husband, and his parents. I visit her every Sunday and take her on her errands but outside of that, she doesn't have much social interaction. What are the ways to alleviate what I am thinking might be her loneliness. How do I get her involved in some kind of social activity that doesn't require one of her children as a buffer/protector? Do we just let her be a loner because maybe that is what she prefers and is comfortable with?"

      "story": "I've been my mom's primary caregiver since 2020. I cared for my dad for a month in 2019 while he was transitioning, until he died in 2020. I've learned so much throughout this process, and I feel like I've aged at least ten years. My mom is now under hospice care at home, but I'm still providing the majority of her care, and I'm literally hanging on by my fingernails at this point, which brings me to the purpose of this story.\n\nMy mom had a friend visit her today, and as I opened the door, she tried to hide her obvious shock over my raggedy appearance. It was almost 2pm, and I hadn't even looked in the mirror, let alone brushed my teeth or fixed my hair. I was braless, wearing raggedy shorts and a stained t-shirt, and I was holding a broom, a measuring tape, a garbage bag full of wet adult diapers, and some room spray. It was obvious from the look on her face that I looked like an absolute fright, but once we got over it, I led her through the extremely unkempt living room and through the even worse dining area and kitchen into my mother's spotless, clean smelling and lovely oasis of a room which I had spent the morning deep cleaning and organizing, in addition to changing her diapers, her clothing, her bedding, fixing her hair, massaging her with lotion, and just joojing her up for her visit. After I got them settled, I realized that I hadn't yet eaten or even had coffee, so I brushed my teeth, dragged a comb through my hair, splashed some water on my face, popped an adderall, and made myself some oatmea and coffeel. As I was choking down my food, I realized that this friend of my mother's hadn't even asked me how \\*I\\* was doing as she made a beeline to my mom, ready to show her with hugs, and gifts, and how are yous.\n\nNow before you launch into what a selfish a-hole I am, I'll just say that I love my mom dearly, and she deserves every bit of love and care that she gets. (which is a LOT) But this all got my gears turning and I realized that NOBODY CARES FOR THE CAREGIVERS! And often times, it's the caregivers who need it most! Sure, there are lots of support groups and organizations that provide respite info., and tips on self care, etc., and I can't speak for all of you, but the daily \"hang in there\" and \"I wish I could be there to help\" calls and texts just don't cut it. And  most of us are either too exhausted to network with other caregivers, or too exhausted to shower, let alone drag our asses to Great Cuts, (my hair is something similar to a mullet and a mohawk) or to call some organization for aging on the phone only to get transferred 20 times and having to repeat why you're calling 20 times, only to get transferred one more time before you get disconnected.\n\nWhat we really need is an organization that can provide the actual care! Right? Because, I don't know about y'all, but because I haven't been able to work, and my mother has no retirement savings, we're barely surviving on her monthly social security check, and we are broke ass broke. I mean, digging quarters out of the couch broke. But I am in such desperate need for some pampering, that I would sell my soul right now for a massage, or a pedicure, or even for someone just to play with my hair for 30 minutes. It's been so long since I've received any care or direct attention that whenever someone does say a kind word or gives me a hug, the tears are right there at the edge of my throat, and I have to struggle to keep them at bay, because if I start to cry, I fear I may never stop!\n\nSo maybe not right this moment, but eventually, I would love to start a nonprofit organization to provide free self-care and wellness services to low-income caregivers, using a pre-established network of health and body care professionals in my area such as massage therapists, aestheticians, Reiki practitioners, acupuncturists, chiropractors, yoga instructors, life coaches, hairdressers, colorists, nail techs, makeup artists, personal stylists, and even clothing stores and boutiques that may want to donate clothing. Most businesses and practitioners benefit from offering a certain amount of pro-bono work per year, not only from a business standpoint but from a personal philanthropic standpoint, as well. So I would start out by contacting these people (in person if and when possible) to explain my mission and see if they'd be interested in participating by donating their time and services, and/or even becoming a board member.\n\nI would then have to come up with a user-friendly application system and max income guidelines to determine eligibility for services. And also a lot more, but this is the general idea.\n\nWhat I'd like to know is are any of you aware of similar organizations that exist? If so, can you point me in their direction? Also, would YOU be excited to know that such an organization existed in your area? If so, would you feel comfortable applying? And lastly, do you agree that caregivers are under-appreciated, overlooked, and underserved? If not, can you explain why?\n\nI would really appreciate any and all feedback - positive or negative (please try and be nice though, as I'm very fragile at the moment. LOL) Thank you in advance for your input!\n\nEDIT: Admins/mods, since this isn't a formal survey or market research, but just an informal feedback request, I'm hoping that you'll let it slide.

It's an awful existence for her right now.\n\nShe's being treated for all of it but our primary issues is the pain.  One of the types of treatment is narcotics.  It used to be going really well - she was staying on top of taking her pain pill as directed 3x/day.  Been doing well w/ it for years.  These past few months she has been getting confused so I have taken over managing the meds.  I had put her midday pain pill in a locked automatic dispenser.  It has a note I have taped to the front telling her not to mess with it if there was no pill in the open compartment.\n\nThis woman has cracked the system.  She has apparently figured out how to force the dispenser to advance and give her pain pills ahead of time.  (It's one of those round ones that advances like an analog clock to put the pills in an open compartment to be accessed.)  Like, she's already taken today's midday pill AND tomorrow's midday pill, and it's not even time for today's pill yet.  The problem is, she doesn't ever remember doing it.  She never does. The desperation for pain relief is causing her to seek it out.  The pills apparently don't give her enough relief which is why she keeps going back and messing with the dispenser.\n\nI realize that we're going to have to make tough decisions about caring for her.  But right now I'm just desperate to get this meds thing under control and get her pain addressed before we do anything else.  I'm scared surgery won't help AND may further exacerbate her memory issues.  And I do not have the capacity to go to her house every afternoon to give her a pain pill, and i don't want her to go without.  \n\nI think I am mainly just venting because it all seems to be without a solution, but if anyone knows about a foolproof automatic pill dispenser that won't kill my wallet, I'm all ears."

      "story": "Hi, there- glad to have found this community\n\nmy father-in-law has parkinsons-related dementia, and my mother-in-law has early but clearly progressing alzheimers. they live a 3 hour flight away from us and are not willing to move to the city where we live, so we have not yet worked out all the kinks in their care.\n\nbecause they were mis-managing their medications, we use a lockbox for their pills and hired a service where a home healthcare professional comes out at scheduled times to administer their medications. in theory, this is a great idea-- no more missed doses, no more double-doses.\n\nunfortunately, they often forget to stay home so that the healthcare aide can give them their medication. Normally, my husband calls them about half an hour prior to their medication time to remind them to stay home and not go out until after their aide gets there to give them their doses. A new challenge is that sometimes they will either already be somewhere else, OR they might be home when he calls to remind them and then forget about the reminder 15 minutes later and go out to the grocery store. Or, sometimes, they forget where their phone is and don't realize he's calling to give them the reminder.\n\nanother challenge: sometimes they will know that one of them has an appointment with a doctor, and my mother-in-law, who insists she can still drive b/c she can still pass a driver's test, will insist on driving instead of taking a Lyft or an Uber, will drive them to \\*A\\* doctor's office, but it's rarely to the right doctor. They often get lost on the way or the way back. It's not great.\n\nWe are planning on taking her car keys; we are researching assisted living and memory care facilities (and how to pay for them, which is a whole other barrel of... well, of something).\n\nIN THE MEANTIME... we are looking at tracking devices. Airtags and Tiles are affordable, but i think something that can a) set \"zones\" so that if they leave a zone -- like their house, when we need them to stay put at home for meds-- it :\n\n* alerts us on OUR phones so that we can call them, \n* function as a wearable, so that they are more likely to have the device on them b/c they often lose their phones, \n* have a voice-calling function/ cell capability so that we can talk to them through the device and tell them to go back home b/c the aide is on the way, and \n* have a reasonably long battery life and/or remote battery monitoring so that we can know when to tell them to charge the thing \n\n  \nA device that seems to fit the bill that i found online today is the Theoracare watch-- has anyone used it? Has it lived up to claims?\n\nIt's not cheap-- about $250 for each device, plus monthly service (about $30)-- i could get a refurbished apple watch and use a different app (boundary care?) for that much, so i'm also curious about similar setups that might be slightly less expensive but which have similar features. Both my father-in-law and mother-in-law are typically together, so I think we might be able to get away with starting with just one device/plan for now, but still- it's a chunk of change, esp given the monthly cell charge.\n\nall suggestions are welcome! -- thank you!"

      "story": "TLDR- 94yr old relative is a hoarder in physical rehab that should go to assisted living (IMO and a few others in the know) and does not want to. How do I get that to not be an option for him without it being known I triggered it? \n\n\\-NY state\n\nLong story-\n\n94yr old relative (not Medicaid eligible) has been living in hoarding conditions for 30+ years. He has me as his health care proxy, so I have power of attorney. I live well over an hour away and cannot take him in.\n\n I knew the house was a mess but did not know the extent until he ended up in the hospital and then rehab. The house is BAD! All rooms and halls packed; new stuff, old food, books, just random stuff. With all of this, rodents have run rampant and it's a disaster. He thinks it's just a mess and due to a part time roommate, but I see this is all him. He insisted he could go back but I knew a LOT of work would be needed to get him there. So after a full dumpster and 3 dump runs with a pickup; the front room and areas he'd need to navigate are 85% ready to go. I did this all to try to keep him content as he wants to be home but realistically, he is much better off in an assisted living facility as he still has a few hurdles that he insists are fine. I know it's a downwards slope (Physical Training, meals, help getting up and occasional toilet help all needed) if he goes home as he wants no help in the home...\n\nDue to the nature of the home, it seems I can get the current facility to contact adult protective services to do a home inspection if I feel it is unsafe. While I want to do that if that'll force into a place where he gets proper care I do not want to be the one listed as why it all started. \n\nBased on my findings today care cost would be about $4400/month all in which he'd be able to afford by using savings. \n\nThis might be more of an AITAH story but I am just trying to take care of him in any way I can. \n\nAny way to approach this other than adult protective services? He has a few more weeks before planned discharge. "

      "story": "My mom has dementia. My dad had a head injury that needed to be operated on in the hospital. I very suddenly got thrust into everything two weeks ago. I called my parents after hearing from others that my dad was not in great shape and realized he needed to be taken to the hospital immediately. I drove 90 minutes to get to my parents to get them to the hospital.\n\nSince that moment I jumped into my car, I've hardly had a moment to relax. Every time I feel like I might be relaxed, I try to get some basic task and realize I'm feeling jumpy because of it. This Saturday was the only time I was able to even sit down and focus on a tv show for more than five minutes at a time.\n\nThe problem is really my family. Here are the issues:\n\n**My mom-**She was a very frustrating person to deal with even before her dementia. Now with her dementia, she has gotten even worse. We tried to visit my dad in the hospital, and she was doing things that should have frustrated him. Whenever he said he wanted something, she would tell the nurses or physical therapists he wanted the opposite. She would also come and tell him things that were aggravating like how she expected the presidential candidate they dislike due to various reasons. She also wouldn't stop talking about random non-sense things the entire time I was with her. It made it really hard to even accomplish something as basic as getting us food to eat. At one point, I just walked away from her, and she screamed, so my nerves were even further on edge. She's also refused to see any specialists about her dementia which means there are no support service in place for her. Now that we want to bring somebody to the house to help them out, she is saying she doesn't want it.\n\n**My dad-**He has been afraid to go against my mom's wishes. Because of that it's hard to get them any help. The doctors say he is at a point where he is competent to make his own decisions. Yet when I try to talk to him, he seems really confused about basic ideas that he would have understood immediately before. It makes conversations with him difficult to understand. He also was driving the day after he returned from the hospital even though the doctors told him not to drive for two weeks.\n\n**My uncle-**I don't really know this uncle as he lives overseas and hasn't visited in over 40 years. It just so happens that his visit coincided with my dad's hospitalization. He brought along an entire family of four other people with him. Since I have social anxiety, I was really stressed out about seeing all of them even before all of this. I've met with them a couple of times now hoping I could at least cross one thing of my to-do list. Each time, he comes back to say he'd like to see more of me. These phone calls often come late at night and stress me out as I'm trying to sleep. Since he works as a physical therapist, he thinks he knows what treatment my dad needs. He's put my sister and I into a panic on a couple of issues saying the doctors or physical/occupational therapists at the hospital are mistreating my dad, and we have to step in and argue with them\n\n **My sister-**She is a bossy older sister. I thought this would actually be helpful as I don't like to be the one in charge in these situations. The problem is she pushes things that aren't really helpful. For instance, she asked my dad what each of us should do to help. My dad was confused and asked me to put together a list of home care agencies even though I'd just shared a list with him. I was ready to move forward with contacting the top-rated agency from the list. Instead of being supportive of me moving forward, she was insisting that my dad said he needed a list so I should come up with another list. There have been a number of requests like this which aren't useful and only seem to stress me out more.\n\nThe only saving grace is my sister's husband. He came over with my sister to help a few days in and has been really useful. He and my sister say they have to leave in a couple of days. I really don't know what I'll do as far as caring for my parents. I live an hour and a half away and have a job and a cat that I'm supposed to be responsible for. I just feel like I need down time to breathe and get my head straight. It seems like every time I try, something happens to get my head spinning again. \n\nI don't know if anybody has any thoughts or suggestions, but I feel like I could just type this out. I just realized I haven't even gotten into the poor financial decisions my family is making recently. That is a whole other story that could take just as long to explain.\n\n"

It helped that his one close friend there recently moved to AL and seems to enjoy it. \n\nAlso, thank you for your thoughtful replies. I read them before I left to see him and incorporated some of your advice into our conversation. I’m so relieved! \n\n———————-\n\nMy dad is 91 years old and is in independent living in a local retirement home that has three levels of care, however it is clear that he really needs to move to assisted living, but he isn’t ready yet. This is his situation. \n\n- He has mobility issues and struggles to get up from a chair and uses a cane everywhere except in his apartment where he will use his walker (he’s too proud to use a walker in public though he can barely shuffle and is very unsteady). He says that it takes him an hour to shower because he has to be so careful of falling, and has actually fallen a few times in his kitchen. \n\n- He forgets to take his medications often and has to be reminded. \n\n- He has severe curvature of his neck and a paralyzed vocal cord which have created issues with swallowing, choking, and limits how much he can eat. \n\n- Despite receiving visits from me, my sister, her husband, and my two adult sons regularly, as well as daily calls from several of us, he complains about being lonely, and frequently says he wants to die. (He has an RX for antidepressants but won’t take them, nor will he accept therapeutic help.)\n\n- He is growing more confused, agitated, and forgetful every day. \n\n- He still drives but he shouldn’t. He used to stand tall at over six feet, but now I can lean down to kiss his forehead and I’m 5’4”, so he barely can see over the steering wheel due to how much he hunches forward. Additionally, because of his neck, he can’t turn to see over his shoulder, let alone behind him, and his reflexes are slow. He also has a bad left shoulder and only uses his right arm to drive. (This matters in general, but is related to assisted living, because if he transitions to it, he’ll have to give up driving.)\n\nI know I can’t force him to move to assisted living from independent, but I wish I could. I worry constantly about him choking, slipping in the shower (or anywhere, frankly), etc. I believe he can stay in his same apartment, but there is also an AL-only floor with openings for identical apartment layouts. He just says he’ll consider it, and then months go by and he gets more and more feeble. Is there anything I can do to help persuade him? "

In the 2nd of 3 but my older sister is estranged and doesn’t come around much and my younger brother is in college so it’s just me that’s been taking on everything. During me coming back I had to sell out family home because all the neglect of 20 years showing it’s ugly face and my mom didn’t gain anything from it financially so she’s staying with me until she gets her house or townhome. I visit my dad very often but it’s draining me and I want to move back to get back to me but i feel so stuck. I’m his only dependable child and his marriage to my mom is a factor\nto his high blood pressure that led to the stroke and let me tell you she’s a pain in the ass and not easy to deal with. She gets into with anyone in the family and my uncles won’t come around when she’s around so how can I trust her with him when i’m gone back to texas. I’m scared she won’t calm down and change her ways and it can lead to another stimuli to cause another stroke. I need advice on what to do for me. I wanna leave and move away and kill live my life but my dad needs me for support and seeing me really puts a smile on his face while in the SNF."

We just can’t pay for a rental for her and pay for the aid coverage so I’m just trying to figure out for those of you that have applied for Medicaid waivers. How successful are you and getting additional coverage of hours and what did those hours look like so that I can kind of have some sort of number to work with? And for anyone that has changed Medicaid between states, I would be moving her into New Jersey and it seems like you have to end coverage in New York and then re-enroll in New Jersey but then there would be a time where she wasn’t covered at all and it seems like New Jersey is backed up so it might be 2 to 3 months. What do people do in the interim, do they just not have coverage or are there emergency services of enrollment until Medicaid is approved? Thanks for the input.

They found a mass in her lung. I have found out that her husband told medical providers that she has advanced dementia, and set her up for hospice home care. She was never presented with any options or information. I am on her Hippa forms and her primary doctor was talking with me but has not stopped responding. She is not sure if she wants cancer treatment until she knows the pros and cons but surely wants other medical care. \n\nthis is part of the note I sent to her primary care:\n\n^(She expressed concern to me the her husband has made some medical choices for her without her knowledge. She consistently maintains that she was told about hospice but not much about other choices. She told me (and I heard from both the husband and caregiver Donna) that her husband Fred insists that he is the person to communicate with hospice and that they are in charge of everything now and she is not to have any other medical care.)\n\n^(The hospital note in the file says this: CM ASK TO TALK W/PT AND PT'S SPOUSE FRED -- PER MD FOR HOSPICE AT HOME PT HAS DEMENTIA SO CM TALKED W/FRED-MPOA AND SPOUSE.

She also just repeats Freds opinions and wishes. They both treat my mother like she has dementia and is sicker than she is. He is restricting her from going out sometimes even.  So I am fighting like hell to make sure my mother’s voice is heard!)\n\n^(We had multiple discussions on what she wants and I hope you can help me get these respected. She wants information! Although she recognizes there may not be great treatment options she wants to know what they are and  what the pros and cons are! She wants to understand more about this disease, how it will impact her and what to expect.  Even if she chooses not to aggressively fight cancer she wants ongoing medical treatment!! Currently the hospice nurse and not even checking her blood pressure. She comes 2x a week asks my mom a few basic questions and goes out in the garage to chat with Fred. She wants to be talk with a counselor or therapist about her feelings and anxiety over all of this but is afraid Fred cause a problem about it.  It is clear that she is not getting the care she needs, wants or deserves!)\n\n^(I assured her that I would contact you  and reminded her that she had her followup appointment with you this Wednesday on 10/23. She became distraught and told me she was worried about that Fred won’t let her attend that.)\n\n*I then went online to sent this and see that her appt was canceled! Can't see by whom and doctor not responding to this note.* \n\nI am in PA. mom is in SC. and it is hard for me travel. My mom is meek and intimated by husband, if reported as elder abuse and she is questioned she may very well defend him.. any ideas? help? I am hesitant to contact hospice as I am not on their contact though on Hippa and if they report to mom's husband I called it will cause her lots of stress with him.\n\nxstory"

It's uncomfortable for her to use more than 10 minutes, which is unfortunate and limiting for her.\n\nWe want to get her a better ride, but she doesn't want to have a conversation about it and is generally not great at articulating her needs anyway, so I'm not confident in our ability to assess her needs ourselves. But she obviously needs a better scooter, and I suspect a power chair would be even better.\n\nWho is the best professional to talk to in this situation? Is this something an occupational therapist would help us address? Is there a formal medical assessment that needs to be made to determine the best device?

I found a home that takes state insurance and they have beds.\n\nThe bad news: my brother passed away a few weeks ago. I was approved as Rep Payee but he was not well enough to add a secondary person to her PoA.\n\nThe other bad news: the bank set the account up as an individual account, not a rep payee account. SS sent her payment after I was appointed to this account because it payed before the direct deposit change went through.\n\nThe really bad news: the bank will not provide the 5 yrs of financial info to the nursing home we are trying to move her to. They will not release any of the funds to me, including the payment after I became rep payee.\n\nThey will only release the funds to SS if SS requests the funds and trying to reach anyone on the phone is almost impossible, especially when I work similar hours. (I work for state government and used all my time off for COVID, my brother's funeral and trying to take care of this and my 3 siblings he also had PoA and Rep Payee for.)\n\nIt looks like I will need to get an attorney and file for guardianship to get this mess straightened out. She also may be eligible for VA benefits (her late husband was a Vietnam era Vet and on VA disability).\n\nWould I be able to pay some of the attorney fees from her SS? I absolutely cannot afford the fees and from the looks of things, filing by myself may not be an option. (I live in PA: some forms are available at the state website but not finding clear guidance from the county as far as the process.)\n\nI am also going to story this in legal advice and SSI reddits.

      "story": "Little backstory: Me, my parents, and my sister all live in the same city. Sister has a few kids with a new baby literally yesterday. My parents are both retired and live in an apartment. My wife and I both have full time jobs. My parents moved to this city because my dad's mental health was declining (Alzheimer's) and so we could all be closer and help my mom(65yo) look after him, as well as get more time together.\n\nAbout 7 weeks ago my dad(73yo) had a massive hemorrhage stroke and was in the ICU for 3 weeks, we did a shunt to save his life, and we did a feeding tube to try to get him strong (I kind of regret these actions now, and feel the doctors pushed us that direction with no explanation about QOL, but that's another thing). From the stroke his left leg and arm became parallelized. His speech luckily remained fully intact as well as his swallowing ability. After the ICU he went to a regular room for about a week where we had a mixture of days. Basically, the cycle looks like this:\n\nDad is lucid and himself, understands to a degree what is happening and where he is, who we all are, and has a strong sense of self (knows his career and his life)\nDad is delusional and sees hallucinations, as well as tells stories about things that didn’t happen. He will say \"I flew to San Antonio last week and a bunch of guys laid on top of me and beat me up\" all kinds of stuff\nDead asleep and peaceful\nPhysical agitation where he sort of flails his body parts around kicking his leg and swinging his arm involuntarily\nNow he’s at a SNF and supposed to be getting rehab. ***Only ONE SNF would even take my dad*** so that tells me he must be in pretty bad shape.\n\nRight now, we get those 4 versions in kind of a cycle. He can't get up or do anything for himself at the moment. He is at a SNF where he is supposed to be getting rehab (SNF is a whole other story) but we haven't seen any progress with the rehab that he is doing. He is still on the feeding tube, but it’s turned off during the day and he almost never wants to eat food, despite being able to.\n\nOkay that's a BRIEF backstory. In 8 days, insurance will more than likely stop paying for his treatment at the SNF, and we will have to take him somewhere else (we could leave him and pay out of pocket, but the place sucks). so, my mom wants to put him in Hospice at a facility citing that he won't feed himself, and she believes his body is shutting down. For a while I agreed with her about Hospice because I hadn't seen any signs of improvement from him and most days he was in the bad parts of the cycle. Yesterday was an amazing lucid day where he was basically himself and begging to go home, to see his dog, to get out of here ETC.\n\nI am now trying to convince my mom to let him come home and do some kind of palliative care or hospice if the doctors allow that, but she has all these bullshit reasons why he can't; \"There's not a lot of space (they have 2 bedroom apartment)\" \"we have the dog, and it would be tough with a nurse coming and going\" \"he weighs too much and I can’t lift him\" \"we don't have any of the stuff to take care of him/ I don't know how\" So my wife and I are talking about taking him in, which isn't ideal because we both work full time ( I myself work about 54 hours Monday to Friday) but I feel a huge amount of resentment building towards my mom if I am the one who has to take him in when she is retired and is his partner (40 years of marriage). I don't want to destroy the relationship I have with my mom over this, but I feel like it could. Does anyone have a similar story or and advice here? I can provide more detail as this is just a mere snippet of the story.\n\n***TDLR: Mom doesn't want to take Dad for Palliative/Hospice care despite being retired. My wife and I are talking about taking my dad despite both working full time jobs. Worried resentment towards my mom is going to happen and ruin our relationship."

While she was in hospital they also gave her a vascular dementia diagnosis and we've noticed a rapid decline in her cognitive function and memory. After 6 weeks of not bearing weight she was cleared to start physio to remobilise to the extent it is possible and she was very excited and happy about it as she absolutely hates being bed bound and having to use diapers. After she was cleared to bear weight she really wanted to try and walk so the carer very gently helped her get up and take about 3 or 4 steps, I think this made her realise she can't simply walk around on her own as her muscles have atrophied and it seems like she has just \"given up\" now and has lost interest in everything, including the physio which she was excited about.\n\nIn the last week she has rapidly lost weight and is VERY thin and eats very little compared to previously and complains of being tired. We got a doctor to come round and check for obvious things like her blood oxygen levels, blood pressure, listen to her lungs, heart, etc - all fine. She is not in any pain or discomfort. (Side note - the doctor was really drunk - I know, it's crazy, but that's a whole 'nother story, we're having the worst luck with medical care, but I figured you can't really screw up a blood oxygen check and we don't have another doctor who is willing to come to the house right now).\n\nShe is also very depressed and just wants to die - she tells us this all the time and has even asked us for a gun. I completely understand, I'd probably feel the same in her circumstance (personally I think we should all have the right to die). \n\nWe just don't know what to do - are we supposed to just watch her slowly starve to death? What's the normal response to this? Reading up on it, I think a factor is a severe lack of exercise which will cause loss of appetite as your metabolism slows down (she's basically been lying in bed for 2 months), but I don't know how we are going to get her to exercise when she doesn't even want to sit in her wheelchair or go for walks or anything. \n\nWe are trying different foods, but she's not even eating much of her favorites anymore, she just simply not getting enough calories. The doctor suggested we try a nutritional supplement shake (https://lifegain.co.za/), any other suggestions? Thanks! :)"

Previously she lived alone in a trailer behind my uncle’s house. My mom and her brother had an arrangement to where he was supposed to check in on her daily and ensure her everyday needs were met, while my mom would take her to her many doctor’s appointments. \n\nThis changed due to worsening dementia and my mom’s discovery that her brother wasn’t reliable on ensuring my granny’s safety. We knew she had some mild age related dementia, but we didn’t realize how bad it had gotten till recently when my granny was hospitalized for several days to due unknowingly overdosing on medicine. My granny cannot reliably be trusted now to take medicine, as she forgets that she took it and keeps taking more, and my uncle can’t/ won’t help. My mom has now had to move my granny in with her to supervise her full time, which has been very difficult. My parents both work full time and can’t leave her alone, as she is getting to the point where it is dangerous for her to be left alone. Additionally, my parents live in a tiny house and are very low income, which makes it difficult to care for her there. \n\nMy mom has had to take temporary leave from work to care for her, but will have to return to work next week. She’s at her wits end and is on the verge of a breakdown due to the stress and the heart ache of seeing her mom like this. She is wanting to place my granny in a nursing home so that she can have the around the clock care she needs. The problem is that my granny’s insurance (Humana) denied this because they stated that my granny “can be taken care of at home.” My mom can’t any longer, though, and we’re not sure what to do.\n\nMy granny had Medicaid but my mom found out last week it was canceled because her brother never completed the continued enrollment forms. She is in the process of trying to get it back but is having a difficult time with this.\n\nWith all of this said, does anyone have any tips or maybe could point me in a direction to trying to affordably place my granny in a nursing home so that she can get the care she needs? Thank you so much in advance and sorry if this is vague, I’m lost as to what to do, I will try to answer any questions if it’ll help get better answers. This is in Tennessee if that helps any. "

Beyond that she isn't going anywhere, and I don't know if she can handle a whole lot of car trips to doctors. Her oncologist (she's been in remission 10+ years) said not to bother bringing her back after a visit a few months ago. He wouldn't treat her if they did find anything and it wasn't worth putting her through the tests. \n\nShe's also pretty quiet these days, and doesn't have much to say unless prompted directly. And what she can say is a few words that trail off into those twisting stories that go nowhere. I don't mind, her voice is still there and I like hearing it. Emotionally, she is happy when asked, and feels safe. She isn't afraid, or argumentative. And she never complains. She's really comfortable and I hold onto that. \n\nI feel like she is well looked after - she's got someone around the clock changing her, moving her around in bed as needed. She hasn't a single bedsore or raw patch of skin on her. Bless these women! She has a good appetite, she kind of just eats whatever you put in front of her, and is a healthy weight and had healthy blood work (except some anemia). Healthy bowel movements. Nice skin color.

      "title": "HELP! I think my brother might be mismanaging / misappropriating  my parents' estate ",
      "story": "I am in way over my head and could use any advice. \n\nMy mother passed away very unexpectedly in July. When she died, my dad was in the hospital after having had a stroke. He has been steadily declining since then - he is bedridden, not super verbal, and has pretty impaired cognition.  Dad is recovering but not in his right mind. He is currently hospitalized and his doctors have concluded he is in the early stages of dementia. After being discharged from the hospital, he’ll go to a skilled nursing facility. Once he is discharged from skilled nursing, he’ll likely go to assisted living or memory care. As recently as June, both of my parents were living independently at home. It has been a huge shock to me and my family.\n\nHere is the issue: My mom was a woman of some means. She owned a very successful small business that operated for many decades. She died with no will other than a handwritten piece of paper saying she wanted to leave everything to me, my dad and my older brother. My older brother is an attorney and I was pretty gobsmacked that he never prepared an official will for my late mom. Apparently she’d asked him to and he refused because it was tough to think about her dying. After my mother’s death, my brother assured me he would get power of attorney for my father, but I recently found out he never did and frankly, I think it is too late. (This now might mean getting the courts involved.) Since then, my brother has really checked out from dad’s care. He hasn’t visited him once during this most recent hospitalization, and it seems like he is just ready for dad to die. \n\nSince my mom died I have had no transparency into the estate, and I am realizing what a mistake it was to trust that my brother would have it under control.  I don’t know how much was in any of my mom’s accounts when she died, or where that money is now. My mom left my dad a million dollar life insurance policy which my brother says he deposited into my dad’s account; I have seen no paperwork to this effect. He physically has my dad's bank card and wallet. \n\nI am worried my brother is at best mismanaging and at worst misappropriating the estate. For most of his life my brother’s finances were very much wrapped up with my parents’ (my brother and his family live for free in a house my parents own for instance ) and I suspect my brother just sees my dad’s money as his money, too, and doesn’t expect anyone to challenge that. (He is the oldest boy,  “the Golden Child,” so he has a lot of entitlement if you know the type. So I am also up against a lot of old family dynamics that make my brother feel like he should defacto be in charge. ) So far I have been managing the day to day of my dad's care despite living three hours away, while my brother just expects to manage the finances while doing nothing and providing no transparency or communication.   \n\nAs I’m starting to have to sort out dad’s long term care situation, I will need more transparency into the finances of the estate because this is how we’ll be paying for his care, but I don’t even know where to start or what I am asking. \n\nI am talking to a trusted relative who is also an attorney tomorrow who is suggesting we hire an estate / elder attorney to help sort it out (I agree.) But I am not even sure what, specifically, I should be asking my brother for transparency about.  If I have no visibility into any of this, how will the estate/elder attorney know where to start? I was thinking I might have a frank call with my brother and ask for whatever information he can give me about the estate and go from there, but I don’t think my brother will play ball. In fact, I think he’ll be hugely threatened that I am pushing this at all. \n\nAny and all advice appreciated. Brother, dad and mom all live(d) in Virginia and I'm in the District of Columbia "

When I came home from the grocery store, the stench about him was unbearable. I insisted he shower and put all his clothes in the wash because he smelled like the bathroom. Later he admitted to dhaving iarrhea all day.\n\nHis hygiene has been off for a while. He has uncontrollable drooling because of his condition. He has difficulty eating, so his clothes are always stained and his face and hands are usually a mess after meals. He has no control over these things, so I accept that and I help him of course.
