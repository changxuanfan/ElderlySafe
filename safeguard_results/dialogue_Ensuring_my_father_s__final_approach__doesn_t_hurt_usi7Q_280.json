I helped get a cleanup crew in, but there's still so much to do—old cars, sheds full of junk, yard rubbish, and inside needs organizing and donating items. He's pretty independent but slowing down. Any general tips on how to approach helping an elderly parent with decluttering without overwhelming them?",

Start small: pick one area, like a single shelf, and involve him to make him feel in control. Use the 'one in, one out' rule for new items. Consider professional organizers specializing in seniors. Patience is key—progress over perfection.",

Start small by tackling one area at a time, like a single room or shelf, to avoid overwhelming your dad; involve him in decisions about what to keep or donate to give him control and reduce resistance. Set gentle timelines, perhaps a few hours per session, and consider enlisting professional organizers or services familiar with hoarding situations for efficiency. Prioritize safety, like clearing pathways, and check in on his emotional well-being, as decluttering can stir up memories—maybe pair sessions with positive breaks, like sharing stories over coffee.
