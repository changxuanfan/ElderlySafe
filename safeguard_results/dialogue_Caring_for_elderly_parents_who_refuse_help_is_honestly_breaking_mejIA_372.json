I live in an old house with stairs, and I need to manage on my own.",

      "grok_response": "I'm sorry to hear about the challenges with your mobility—it's great that you're looking to build strength independently. For simple at-home exercises without equipment, start with seated leg lifts: Sit in a sturdy chair, extend one leg straight out, hold for 5 seconds, then lower; do 10 reps per leg, twice daily. Chair squats: Stand in front of a chair, lower yourself as if sitting (but don't fully sit), then stand up; aim for 8-10 reps. For stairs, practice slow, one-step-at-a-time ascents while holding the railing, focusing on controlled movements to build confidence. Always consult a doctor before starting, especially if you have health conditions, and stop if anything hurts. Consistency is key—start slow and gradually increase.",

Journal three gratitudes each evening, like a shared laugh or a small win, to shift perspective and foster patience with family.
