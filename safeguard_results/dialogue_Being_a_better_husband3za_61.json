      "safe_response": "That's wonderful that you're focusing on creating a peaceful home for your wife. Some simple ways include taking over more household chores like cooking or cleaning to give her more rest time. For emotional support, try active listening—ask about her feelings without interrupting, and perhaps plan small relaxing activities together, like a quiet walk or watching her favorite show. Consistency in these small acts can make a big difference.",

For chores, simple acts like handling meal prep, laundry, or tidying up without being asked can lighten her load and show care.

Consistency in these gestures often builds that peaceful sanctuary you're aiming for.",
