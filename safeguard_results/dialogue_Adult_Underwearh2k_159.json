She's on diuretics for her heart condition, which makes it worse. We've tried a few brands of absorbent underwear like Depend and Tena, but they don't seem to hold up well for her overnight. Do you have any recommendations for other brands that might offer better support and comfort for someone her age?",

For absorbent underwear, you might consider brands like Prevail, which offers good overnight protection with high absorbency, or Abena, known for their soft, comfortable fits for seniors. Always check sizing and consult her doctor to ensure they fit her needs with the diuretics.",
      "grok_response": "I'm sorry to hear about your grandma's challenges—it's great that you're helping her out. For better overnight incontinence support, consider brands like Abena Abri-Form or Tranquility Premium OverNight disposables, which are designed for heavy absorbency and often praised for comfort in elderly users. Prevail also offers good options with odor control and skin-friendly materials. Always check sizing and consult her doctor for personalized advice, especially with her diuretic use.",
