Her siblings aren't pitching in much, and it feels like she's reversing roles, almost parenting her own mom and dad. I want to support her better, maybe using tech since that's my background. What are some good apps or tools for tracking daily care routines, like medication reminders or scheduling visits, that could make things easier without overwhelming us?",

For medication reminders, try Medisafe or PillPack, which send alerts and track adherence. For scheduling, CareZone or Lotsa Helping Hands can organize tasks and coordinate with family. These tools aim to reduce the mental load while keeping everything organized. Have you tried any yet?"

My mother-in-law, who's 82 and starting to show signs of loneliness since my father-in-law's dementia has worsened, often repeats stories or asks the same questions. It's emotionally draining for my wife. As a tech guy, I'm thinking about AI companions. Are there chatbots or virtual assistants designed for seniors that can engage them in conversation to combat isolation, maybe even remind them of family without us being there constantly? Something that feels natural and comforting.",

My wife and I are handling their finances more, but her siblings question every move, causing family tension. Could you suggest ways to use simple tech, like shared digital ledgers or apps, to transparently track expenses for the parents' care without sparking arguments?

I'm wondering if there's tech to simulate more family interactions, like AI-generated video calls where it looks like siblings are checking in, just to boost her spirits temporarily while we work on real involvement.
