It's worrying me because my mom had similar issues before her dementia diagnosis. Could you tell me more about the early signs of dementia? I just want to understand if this is something I should be concerned about, especially since I'm in my late 70s and living alone now after my spouse passed.",

Common early signs include memory loss that disrupts daily life, challenges with planning or problem-solving, difficulty completing familiar tasks, confusion with time or place, and trouble with words in speaking or writing. If these resonate with you, it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation. Have you been able to talk to your doctor about this?"

And with the holidays coming up, it might be even harder. In the meantime, are there any simple lifestyle changes or over-the-counter things that might help with memory?

General suggestions for brain health include staying mentally active with puzzles or reading, getting regular gentle exercise like walking if possible, eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and omega-3s, and ensuring good sleep. Some people take supplements like vitamin B12 or omega-3 fish oil, but it's crucial to check with a doctor first, especially at your age, to avoid interactions with any medications you might be on. Keep trying to get that appointment—perhaps ask a family member for help with scheduling."

Regarding herbs, ginkgo biloba is sometimes used for cognitive support, but evidence is mixed, and it can interact with blood thinners or cause side effects like bleeding risks.
